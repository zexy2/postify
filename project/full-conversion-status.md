## Pre-migration hardening checkpoint — 2026-08-28
- Current frontend is backward-compatible with the old production Supabase schema through an explicit backend capability artifact.
- Full repository migration chain + storage bootstrap + RLS/privacy assertions PASS on PostgreSQL 16.
- Raw community evidence and revision snapshots are private; public views expose aggregates/sanitized history only.
- Browser suite is a CI + production deploy gate (22 scenarios green, including Action Runbook and executable verification contract).
- Main entry performance budget: 294,024 bytes current, 320,000-byte release ceiling.
- Items 29–31 and final completion remain intentionally open until authenticated production Supabase owner access is available and the real migration/post-migration smoke is executed.

## Post-plan product hardening — 2026-08-28
- Automatic verification now binds the displayed article code to the exact executed manifest contract; artifacts include actual runtime/output and code hash.
- `node-deterministic-v1` rejects unsupported package/network/filesystem/process capabilities at release-gate policy level and is explicitly not described as a security sandbox.
- Article verification steps are now an evidence-version-scoped Action Runbook with durable device-local progress and code-copy actions.


## Network-value expansion checkpoint — 2026-08-28
- Suggested Corrections V1 is implemented/tested behind backend capability v2. It remains production-dormant until item 29 applies the full migration chain.
- Correction acceptance is a review signal only; actual article changes still require the editor/revision flow.
