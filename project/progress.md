# Postify Progress

## 2026-08-28 — Product value MVP implemented locally
Completed:
- Audited repository structure, homepage, article, navigation, fallback content, and build setup.
- Chose a practical-knowledge positioning instead of a generic Medium-style blog proposition.
- Created persistent project memory: context, requirements, decisions, backlog, known issues, reports, and specs.
- Reworked the homepage value proposition around usable knowledge: guides, decision notes, explainers, and field notes.
- Replaced the glow-heavy primary feed with a calmer utility-oriented lead + list layout.
- Added frontend-only content-type derivation so existing Supabase rows do not require a schema migration yet.
- Added neutral freshness/date presentation without fake “verified” claims.
- Added an article “before you read” panel showing expected outcome, content type, reading time, and relevant date.
- Simplified the header/navigation and preserved search, auth, bookmarks, language, theme, profile/admin routes.
- Preserved fallback-content behavior and Turkish/English support.

Verification:
- `npm ci`: PASS in `node:20-alpine` Docker.
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 0 errors and the same 1 pre-existing React Hooks warning in `src/components/ui/design-testimonial.jsx`.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- No Supabase schema or production deployment changes were made.

Current branch:
- `chatgpt/postify-rethink` on the Oracle development clone `/opt/postify-dev`.

Next:
- Preview the product-value MVP in a browser and fix visual/interaction issues found there.
- Then implement author-side structured templates (Guide / Decision / Explainer / Field Note) without requiring Supabase schema changes yet.

## Overnight loop checkpoint — 04:15 TRT
- Production deployment is now explicitly permitted after quality gates pass.
- Continuing autonomous product-development loops on `chatgpt/postify-rethink`.


## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch (7+ loops)
Completed in this run:
1. Restored the documented test command and added focused tests for Postify content presentation.
2. Removed the remaining React Hooks lint warning; lint now passes with zero warnings/errors.
3. Added four author writing modes (Guide / Decision note / Explainer / Field note) with localized, actionable writing briefs and no database dependency.
4. Added safe local draft autosave/restore with user+language scoped keys and tests.
5. Added reader-side format filtering so discovery can be driven by intended outcome, not only category/search.
6. Hardened SEO/PWA identity: Postify naming, practical-knowledge description, canonical URL normalization, Article structured data, correct app icon metadata, Turkish static document language.
7. Added a repeatable release gate (`npm run verify`) plus build artifact smoke checks and a runtime Vite preview smoke for `/` and an article SPA route.
8. Updated README to reflect the new product positioning and release workflow.

Evidence:
- `npm test`: 10 test files / 42 tests PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS, zero warnings/errors.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- `npm run smoke:build`: PASS.
- Runtime preview smoke: `/` HTTP 200 and `/posts/ai-muhendisligi` HTTP 200.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

Production status:
- Quality gates are green. Deployment via the current GitHub Pages path will be attempted after checkpoint commit.


### Follow-up loop — language accessibility + deploy attempt
- Added dynamic `<html lang>` synchronization when the user switches Turkish/English.
- Re-ran `npm run verify`: 10 test files / 42 tests PASS, lint clean, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Attempted the repository's existing GitHub Pages deploy path after gates were green.
- First deploy attempt exposed Docker git safe-directory context; strategy was corrected.
- Second deploy reached GitHub but failed because the Oracle workspace has no GitHub HTTPS write credential (`could not read Username for https://github.com`).
- Connected GitHub integration also returned HTTP 403 when creating a branch, confirming there is no usable repository write path from this run.
- Production was left untouched and remains healthy: `https://postify.zekiakgul.dev/` returned HTTP 200 and still serves the prior `Postify Blog` build.
- No DNS/hosting architecture switch was attempted as a workaround; preserving the healthy production site is safer than rerouting hosting solely to bypass missing GitHub credentials.


## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch: author quality + reader utility
Completed in this run:
1. Added a publish-readiness panel that separates required title/body checks from advisory scannable-structure guidance.
2. Added live author metrics for word count and estimated reading time.
3. Added safe one-click starter outlines for Guide / Decision note / Explainer / Field note; outlines add structure only and never fabricate article content.
4. Added deterministic article heading anchors and an automatic “On this page / Bu yazıda” outline when enough headings exist.
5. Added a transparent external-reference section that only surfaces URLs actually present in article content; same-origin links are excluded.
6. Added keyboard skip navigation, global focus-visible treatment, and accessible loading status semantics.
7. Added a ≤5-minute quick-read discovery filter alongside content-format filters.

Verification evidence:
- Focused tests for publish readiness, writing metrics, writing templates, and article structure: PASS.
- Full `npm run verify`: 13 test files / 52 tests PASS, lint PASS with zero warnings/errors, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Runtime Vite preview smoke: `/`, `/posts/ai-muhendisligi`, `/posts/create` all HTTP 200; product HTML metadata check PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

Release note:
- GitHub write access has since been restored through the connected GitHub integration. This batch is eligible for branch push/PR/CI and production release after the checkpoint commit.

## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch: resilient drafts + shareable discovery
Completed in this run:
1. Fixed restored drafts so their selected writing mode is restored with the content.
2. Made content-format discovery state URL-addressable via the `type` query parameter.
3. Made quick-read discovery state URL-addressable via the `reading=quick` query parameter.
4. Preserved category/type/reading filters when any one filter changes instead of overwriting sibling query state.
5. Reset feed pagination when category changes and added explicit group semantics to format/time filters.
6. Made quick-read filtering derive reading time from body/excerpt when API metadata is absent, while excluding posts with no measurable text; added unit coverage.
7. Connected title validation and character-count feedback to the title input with `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and alert semantics.

Verification: focused post-presentation/draft tests pass (10/10); full `npm run verify` passes with 13 test files / 53 tests, lint clean, production build PASS, and build smoke PASS. Runtime preview smoke returned HTTP 200 for `/`, the combined filter URL, and `/posts/create`; HTML product marker PASS.

Production check after the batch: root returned HTTP 200 and serves the newer Postify identity, but a direct article deep link returned HTTP 404. Therefore this run does not claim a successful production deploy; deep-link hosting fallback is recorded as a release issue.

## 2026-08-28 — Final release validation
- Re-ran the full release gate after the overnight batches: 13 test files / 53 tests PASS, lint clean, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Hardened the GitHub Pages SPA fallback release gate: `docs/404.html` is now a required build artifact and its redirect/product identity are verified.
- Updated the fallback page from the stale “Postify Blog” identity to “Postify — Uygulanabilir Bilgi”.
- Production root remains healthy; direct article requests currently return GitHub Pages HTTP 404 before client-side fallback, so release verification must distinguish HTTP status from browser redirect behavior.

### Final deploy attempt — blocked by repository authentication
- Final source commit created locally: `78ecfb4` (`fix: harden pages deep-link fallback`).
- `git push -u origin chatgpt/postify-rethink` failed because the Oracle host has no GitHub HTTPS credential.
- `gh auth status` confirms no authenticated GitHub session; SSH auth to `git@github.com` also fails with `Permission denied (publickey)`; no GH/GITHUB token environment variables are present.
- Production remains healthy at the root (HTTP 200) but still serves the prior fallback identity (`Postify Blog`) at `/404.html`, proving the final fallback hardening has not been deployed yet.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V2 parallel worktree kickoff
- Split the UI redesign into isolated foundation, home/discovery, article, editor, and QA worktree lanes.
- Integrated the first four UI lanes into `chatgpt/postify-ui-v2` without functional/schema changes.
- Foundation: warmer editorial palette, calmer typography system, simplified header, direct Guides/Decisions/Field Notes navigation.
- Discovery: typography-led hero, useful primary/secondary actions, quieter search treatment, flatter featured story and filter styling.
- Article: removed card/glass reading shell in favor of a cleaner editorial page, larger display hierarchy and quieter utility rail.
- Editor: removed gradient/card treatment and moved toward a focused writing workspace with structured format/readiness tools retained.
- Verification after integration: 13 test files / 53 tests PASS, lint PASS, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Runtime Vite preview root returned HTTP 200. Host Chromium screenshot automation is blocked by Snap cgroup restrictions under the MCP service, so this batch is not being auto-deployed before a real visual/browser QA pass.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V2 parallel pass 2
- Refined the editorial feed and category discovery: flatter surfaces, stronger serif hierarchy, calmer metadata, underline-style filters, less card chrome.
- Reworked bookmarks/profile/public author surfaces to match the editorial system and removed legacy gradient/glass treatments from the main account flows.
- Fixed the public author bookmark callback to match the current `EditorialFeed` contract and made bookmarked links slug-aware.
- Simplified the footer, removed the giant display banner, shifted category links to Postify content formats, and added a global reduced-motion safeguard.
- Added a dedicated Chromium UI V2 E2E smoke covering desktop discovery/navigation, direct article rendering, 390px mobile overflow/menu, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Verification: full `npm run verify` PASS (13 files / 53 tests, lint, production build, build smoke) and Playwright Chromium UI smoke PASS (4/4).

## 2026-08-28 — UI V2 polish pass 3
- Calmed login/auth and 404 recovery surfaces by removing decorative orb/gradient motion and emphasizing typography + clear actions.
- Brought analytics/admin dashboards into the same flat editorial system: lighter surfaces, fewer shadows, stronger separators, quieter status treatments.
- Simplified secondary sharing, bookmark and fallback post-card controls; removed platform-color spectacle and hover scale/glow behavior.
- Expanded Chromium UI smoke from 4 to 6 scenarios with login and unknown-route recovery coverage.
- Verification: `npm run verify` PASS (13 files / 53 tests, lint, production build, build smoke) and Playwright Chromium UI smoke PASS (6/6).

## 2026-08-28 — UI cleanup v4
- Removed the oversized “Postify Standardı” manifesto block from Home; discovery now moves directly from hero into topics/formats/content.
- Mobile format filters now stay in one horizontally scrollable row instead of wrapping into a large two-row control block.
- Rebuilt About as a concise product explanation instead of a founder/tech-stack portfolio showcase.
- Rebuilt Contact as two direct channels plus a short contact-purpose note; removed glowing/bento presentation.
- Restyled article comments into the same quiet editorial system.
- Expanded Chromium UI smoke to 9 scenarios covering About, Contact, and mobile filter layout.
- Full verify PASS: 13 files / 53 tests, lint, production build, artifact smoke. Chromium UI smoke PASS: 9/9.

## 2026-08-28 — Verified Knowledge V1
- Repositioned the product from generic practical publishing toward explicit evidence/freshness semantics.
- Added deterministic evidence model + tests; absent evidence is never upgraded to verification.
- Added honest author-tested sample evidence to the local catalogue, including environment, tested date, verification steps and caveats.
- Discovery now exposes evidence/freshness and a current-evidence filter.
- Article detail now explains evidence, freshness, environment, prerequisites and verification steps, with an explicit author-claim disclaimer.
- Added device-local Worked/Didn't work evidence and Try later/Using/Reference shelf states; no fake community aggregates.
- Added zero-result Knowledge Gap capture stored only on-device.
- Authoring draft now collects outcome, test date, environment and verification steps and includes them in readiness scoring; production persistence remains deferred pending schema review.
- Added `llms.txt` trust semantics to static release and build smoke.
- Verification baseline expanded to 15 test files / 59 unit tests and 12 Chromium UI scenarios.

## 2026-08-28 — Verified Knowledge full product conversion
- Added additive production schema for post evidence, confirmations, revisions, knowledge gaps, private shelf state and aggregate evidence views.
- Migration passes PostgreSQL 16 dry-run and idempotency; RLS integration test passes self-confirmation, duplicate inflation, private shelf, gap dedupe, revision ownership and re-verification boundaries.
- Authoring now persists structured evidence and edit mode performs real updates with revision snapshots.
- Added real community confirmations/failure reports and minimum-sample aggregate rules.
- Added author Knowledge Health dashboard with re-verification queue, knowledge demand and evidence-gated domain credibility.
- Added evidence-aware discovery ranking/filtering and persistent authenticated knowledge gaps/shelf states.
- Added the first real `Postify verified` execution: deterministic Node.js code is run in the release gate; failed expected output fails release.
- Added machine-readable verification and per-article JSON artifacts plus structured citations/alternate JSON metadata.
- CI now includes a PostgreSQL schema/RLS gate. Deploy workflow now reads existing Supabase Action secrets correctly and exports production knowledge artifacts after build.
- Local release verification: 19 test files / 67 tests PASS; lint/build/smoke PASS; Chromium 15/15 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Pre-Supabase hardening and release-gate expansion
- Added explicit `knowledge-backend-status.json` capability gating so the same frontend is compatible with both the current production schema and the future Verified Knowledge schema.
- Public `postService` now retries legacy post fields when additive evidence columns are absent instead of dropping the whole live catalogue to fallback content.
- Authenticated/community features remain honestly local-only while the production backend upgrade is pending; the Knowledge Health dashboard explains the pending state instead of firing broken requests.
- Expanded author evidence UI with prerequisites, verification steps, caveats, sources, freshness window and revision reason. Publish is disabled until the persistent backend capability is active.
- Sanitized structured-data citations to HTTP(S) URLs only.
- Added immutable follow-up migration `20260828144850_evidence_integrity_and_privacy.sql`: DB evidence integrity trigger/constraints, author-writable status restriction, private raw confirmations/revision snapshots, aggregate public failure view and sanitized public revision history.
- PostgreSQL 16 full migration chain dry-run passes all five repository migrations plus RLS/privacy assertions, including cross-user confirmation privacy and anonymous raw-snapshot denial.
- CI schema job now applies every migration in repository order and bootstraps the minimal Supabase Storage contract required for a faithful dry-run.
- Added Chromium E2E as a deploy dependency; production cannot deploy when the 20-scenario browser suite fails.
- First-load profiling removed eager `react-icons/fa`, Framer Motion/AI UI barrel loading, Command Palette, Radix mobile sheet and knowledge-service code from the discovery critical path.
- Production main entry reduced from ~338.6 KB / 111.3 KB gzip to ~294.0 KB / 96.9 KB gzip. Build smoke now enforces a 320 KB entry budget and forbids eager preload of sheet/knowledgeService/editor/motion chunks.
- Current gates: deterministic Node verifier PASS; 20 test files / 74 tests PASS; lint PASS; production build + artifact/performance smoke PASS; local Chromium product suite 20/20 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Privacy, compatibility, performance and production-observability hardening
- Added an immutable follow-up migration instead of rewriting the already-merged Verified Knowledge migration history.
- Database trust enforcement now rejects author-written `postify-verified`, future `tested_at`, and incomplete `author-tested` evidence.
- Raw confirmations are user-private; raw revision snapshots are author/admin-only. Public failure evidence is aggregate-only and public revision history excludes snapshots.
- Added owner/admin-only `get_post_failure_details` RPC returning environment/note/date without contributor identity, plus an on-demand author dashboard panel.
- Added HTTP(S)-only citation sanitization before JSON-LD output.
- Added explicit backend capability gating and legacy post-read fallback so one frontend release works safely before and after production migration.
- Verified publishing is disabled while backend capability is pending; local draft/autosave stays available instead of silently losing evidence fields.
- CI now runs full Chromium product E2E as a deploy dependency and applies every repository migration in order in a fresh PostgreSQL schema job.
- Deploy now stamps `release.json`; a post-deploy job waits for the exact source SHA on the custom domain, probes machine-readable artifacts/capability, then runs the Chromium suite against production.
- First-load hardening lazy-loads Command Palette/mobile Sheet/knowledge service and removes the AI barrel from the eager Redux path. Entry chunk is ~294 KB versus ~338.6 KB before; build smoke enforces a 320 KB budget.
- Current local gates: deterministic Node verification PASS; 20 test files / 75 tests PASS; lint/build/artifact/performance smoke PASS; full migration chain + RLS/privacy assertions PASS; Chromium 20/20 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Production smoke compatibility fix
- Production SHA attestation proved the live site was serving the exact merged source SHA.
- Production Chromium/network probing found avoidable Supabase 400 responses before the Verified Knowledge schema migration: public post reads requested additive evidence columns first, then fell back to legacy fields.
- Public post queries now consult the deployed knowledge capability contract first and choose legacy fields immediately while `ready:false`, eliminating expected pre-migration API 400 noise.
- Production browser observability now distinguishes GitHub Pages' known initial deep-link document 404 from unexpected API/subresource 4xx/5xx responses; API/resource failures remain release-blocking.
- GitHub Actions public Supabase URL/publishable key were aligned with the production client already served by the live site; this does not grant schema-management access.

## 2026-08-28 — Action Runbook V1
- Turned evidence `verificationSteps` into an interactive article runbook so Postify content can be applied, not only read.
- Runbook progress is stored device-locally and keyed to `evidence_version`; a new evidence version invalidates old completion state instead of carrying stale checks forward.
- Completing a runbook never creates a `Postify verified` claim. The completed state links readers to the existing Worked/Didn't Work evidence flow.
- Added copyable fenced code blocks with language labels and a clipboard fallback when the modern Clipboard API is denied.
- Added keyboard-operable runbook checkboxes, progress semantics, reset, mobile layout, reduced-motion behavior, and clear local-only trust copy.
- Verification baseline: 20 test files / 80 tests PASS, lint/build/smoke PASS, Chromium product suite 22/22 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Production read noise hardening
- Production network probing found one remaining avoidable Supabase 400 after the schema-capability fix: a missing fallback slug was retried against the UUID `posts.id` column.
- Added a strict UUID guard so non-UUID slugs never enter the ID lookup path.
- Current verification on the combined main + Action Runbook baseline: 20 unit/integration files / 81 tests PASS; lint/build/artifact smoke PASS; Chromium 22/22 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Production migration runner prepared
- Added a manual-only Supabase production migration workflow pinned to CLI 2.116.0 and project `fuiwcrqmxndguxymwoin`.
- The workflow validates owner credentials, links the exact project, lists remote migration history, performs a dry-run without `--include-all`, and refuses apply unless the exact production confirmation is supplied.
- Successful apply re-reads migration history, probes the three new public evidence views with the production publishable key, then triggers the full main CI/deploy/production-browser pipeline.
- No production migration is performed by normal push/PR events.

## 2026-08-28 — Profile URL trust-boundary hardening
- Supabase management access rechecked: CLI is installed but no authenticated access token is available; production migration remains untouched.
- Added a shared HTTP/HTTPS-only URL normalizer for user-controlled public links.
- Profile website saves now reject non-HTTP(S) schemes; previously stored unsafe values are not rendered as clickable links.
- Profile service normalization applies the same boundary so future public profile consumers receive a safe URL or `null`.
- Verification: focused URL tests PASS; full `npm run verify` PASS with 20 files / 81 tests; Chromium CI-parity E2E PASS 22/22.

## 2026-08-28 — Verification Contract V2
- Removed verifier/article code duplication for the first Postify Verified Node.js example. The article now renders the exact code stored in the verification manifest.
- The release verifier fails if an automatic verification manifest entry cannot find a matching article or if the article no longer contains the exact executed code.
- Verification artifacts now expose the actual Node runtime version, expected stdout, actual stdout, SHA-256 of the executed code, policy id and `articleContractMatched` state.
- Added `node-deterministic-v1` release policy: narrow checked-in snippets reject external packages, dynamic imports, network APIs, filesystem builtins, process execution APIs, eval/Function and non-output process access. Execution remains explicitly documented as checked-in child-process execution, not a security sandbox.
- Full gate: 22 test files / 89 tests PASS, deterministic verifier/article contract PASS, lint/build/smoke PASS, Chromium 22/22 PASS.

## 2026-08-28 — Reproducible command/output verification contract
- Extended verification artifact schema to v3 with a downloadable `.mjs`, reproduction command, expected/actual stdout, artifact hash and execution mode.
- The release verifier now executes the generated artifact file itself and rejects code/artifact hash drift.
- Evidence UI exposes the local command, expected output, actual CI output and exact executed file.
- Build smoke and Chromium coverage require the reproduction artifact and command/hash contract.
## 2026-08-28 — Production Supabase activation + advisor hardening
- Confirmed authenticated Supabase management access and inspected the live schema before any DDL: 8 posts, 16 translations, 2 profiles, no drafts/null publish timestamps, RLS enabled on the existing public tables.
- Applied the base/content/security migrations idempotently, restoring missing `comment_likes` policies and creating the expected `avatars` / `post-images` storage buckets.
- Applied Verified Knowledge and privacy/integrity migrations to production; evidence columns, confirmations, revisions, Knowledge Gaps, private shelf state, integrity trigger and owner-only failure-detail RPC are live.
- Ran a fresh PostgreSQL 16 migration-chain dry-run plus the full RLS/abuse verification: PASS (`verified knowledge RLS PASS`).
- Supabase security advisor initially found 3 ERROR-level SECURITY DEFINER public views plus anonymous definer RPC execution. Added and applied a follow-up hardening migration using SECURITY INVOKER public views over narrow private-schema helpers and removed anonymous RPC EXECUTE grants. Security ERROR findings are now 0.
- Added covering foreign-key indexes, removed the duplicate slug index, split the translation ALL policy, and converted RLS auth lookups to init-plan-safe `(select auth.uid())`. Performance advisor no longer reports unindexed-FK, auth-initplan, duplicate-index or multiple-permissive-policy findings.
- Production migration history now records six migrations; repository filenames were aligned to those exact remote versions without `migration repair`.
- Remaining Supabase security advisor warnings are two intentional authenticated SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`request_knowledge_gap`, `get_post_failure_details`) with explicit auth/ownership checks, plus the project-level leaked-password-protection Auth setting.

## 2026-08-28 — Production activation release gates
- Full `npm run verify` PASS after production migration alignment: deterministic knowledge verification, 22 test files / 89 tests, lint, production build and artifact/performance smoke.
- The previously observed Chromium failure reproduced as a local parallel-worker flake only; the isolated case PASS and the CI-parity Chromium suite (`CI=true`, 1 worker) PASS 22/22 without weakening assertions.
- `npm ci` reports 28 advisories across the full dependency tree. Repeated online `npm audit` classification timed out from Oracle; offline audit output is not treated as authoritative, so production-vs-dev impact is not claimed yet.
## 2026-08-28 — Canonical production Verified example + stale-artifact hardening
- Found a trust-consistency gap: `node-json-dogrulama` existed in the fallback catalogue/build artifacts but not in production Supabase, while the production exporter overlaid live artifacts without deleting stale fallback JSON.
- Automatic verification now binds only when the production slug and the exact displayed fenced code match the checked-in verification manifest; code drift therefore removes the binding instead of preserving a misleading badge.
- Production knowledge export now clears the fallback-generated knowledge directory only after a successful Supabase schema/data read, then writes the canonical production set and attaches release verification only to exact code matches.
- Applied production migration `20260828155643_publish_verified_node_example.sql` through authenticated Supabase management access. The new database row intentionally remains `evidence_status=unverified`, `tested_at=null`, has no attributed author, and has TR/EN translations; `Postify verified` is derived only from the release execution artifact.
- Verified both production migration code blocks are byte-equivalent after newline normalization to the manifest code (2/2 exact). Fresh PostgreSQL 16 full migration chain + RLS/abuse verification PASS.
- Full release gate PASS: 22 Vitest files / 90 tests, deterministic verifier/article contract, lint, build and build smoke. Official Playwright v1.57 Chromium container PASS 22/22.
- Playwright local preview port is now configurable with `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT`; default CI behavior remains 4173 and unrelated server processes are not terminated.
## 2026-08-28 — Private RPC privilege boundary
- Moved privileged Knowledge Gap mutation and author failure-detail reads behind `private` SECURITY DEFINER helpers; the PostgREST-exposed `public.request_knowledge_gap` and `public.get_post_failure_details` signatures now remain SECURITY INVOKER wrappers.
- Anonymous EXECUTE remains denied; authenticated callers retain the same public RPC contract. Fresh PostgreSQL 16 migration/RLS/abuse verification PASS, including a new assertion that these public RPCs can never regress to SECURITY DEFINER.
- Applied production migration `20260828161849_private_rpc_boundary.sql` through authenticated Supabase management access and aligned the repository filename to the exact remote ledger version.
- Production transaction smoke used an existing profile, confirmed Knowledge Gap normalization/deduplication (`duplicate_count=1`), confirmed unauthorized failure-detail rejection, and rolled back with 0 persisted smoke rows. Production has no authored posts, so the positive author-only failure-detail path remains verified in the fresh PostgreSQL RLS test rather than by fabricating production data.
- Supabase security advisor no longer reports authenticated SECURITY DEFINER RPC warnings; the only remaining security advisor warning is the project-level leaked-password-protection Auth setting.
- Full release verify PASS: 22 Vitest files / 90 tests, deterministic verification, lint, build and build smoke. Official Playwright v1.57 Chromium suite PASS 22/22.

## 2026-08-28 — Dependency security baseline + recurring monitoring
- Reclassified the previously unresolved npm advisory set using online audit against the committed lock: baseline was 9 production vulnerabilities (6 high, 3 moderate) and 28 full-tree vulnerabilities (1 critical, 20 high, 6 moderate, 1 low).
- Rejected a broad semver-compatible refresh that changed 33 direct package resolutions. Two non-force `npm audit fix --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` passes from the committed lock instead reached 0 production / 0 full-tree vulnerabilities while changing six direct resolutions and leaving `package.json` ranges unchanged.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly npm and GitHub Actions version monitoring. Routine npm minor/patch version updates are grouped by dependency type; security updates are intentionally not grouped by this configuration.
- Clean validation of the selected minimal lock PASS: Node 20 `npm ci`, deterministic verification, 22 Vitest files / 90 tests, lint, production build/smoke, official Playwright 1.57 Chromium 22/22, and final independent npm audit 0/0.
- A broad semver refresh candidate also reached audit 0 but failed Chromium badly (21/22 failures), validating the smaller remediation strategy; it was not selected or committed.
## 2026-08-28 — Fail-closed dependency release gate
- Added `npm run verify:security` to CI immediately after clean install. The gate requires npm audit to report zero vulnerabilities and fails closed on audit/network/non-JSON errors instead of treating missing data as clean.
- Exact-pinned `@playwright/test` at `1.57.0` and assert both Playwright CI container images match that package version, preventing browser/package drift from producing misleading E2E results.
- Tightened Dependabot version-update automation to SemVer minor/patch only; major upgrades remain manual compatibility work. Playwright is excluded from the grouped development PR so its package + browser image update can be reviewed together. GitHub Actions minor/patch updates are grouped.
- Clean Node 20 gate PASS: `npm ci`, online dependency audit 0 vulnerabilities, release security parity, deterministic verification, 22 Vitest files / 90 tests, lint, production build and build smoke.
- Official Playwright v1.57 Chromium clean workspace PASS 22/22.

## 2026-08-28 — Node 24 LTS verification runtime
- Moved hosted verify/deploy runtime from Node 20 to exact Node `24.20.0` and declared `runtimeMajor: 24` / `runtimeChannel: lts` in the automatic verification manifest.
- The verifier now fails closed with `runtime-major-mismatch` outside Node 24; an isolated Node 20 negative test PASS confirmed that the old runtime can no longer mint a passing release artifact.
- Clean Node `24.20.0` release gate PASS: npm audit 0, dependency/browser parity PASS, deterministic verification, 22 Vitest files / 90 tests, lint, build and build smoke. Official Playwright 1.57 Chromium PASS 22/22 on its bundled Node 24 runtime.
- Fresh PostgreSQL 16 full migration chain + RLS/abuse verification PASS with the Node LTS metadata migration. A focused DML invariant check confirmed only prerequisites change while `unverified`, `tested_at=null`, empty environment and evidence version 1 remain unchanged.
- Applied production migration `20260828171756_update_node_verification_lts.sql`. Production `node-json-dogrulama` now requires `Node.js 24 LTS`; evidence remains `unverified`, community worked/failed/confirmation counts remain 0, and no verification state was fabricated.

## 2026-08-28 — Automatic Node runtime freshness invalidation
- Added `runtime-release-status.json`, generated from the official Node.js distribution index during build/dev preparation. The artifact binds each automatic verification id to the executed runtime version, required major, latest Node LTS version/major, signal timestamp and one of `current`, `recheck-required`, or `unknown`.
- `Postify verified` now requires both a successful deterministic execution and a `current` runtime release signal. Newer Node LTS patch/major releases withhold the badge as `recheck-required`; source outage/contradiction withholds it as freshness `unknown`. Historical code/hash/output/runtime proof remains visible instead of being deleted.
- Discovery filtering/ranking no longer upgrades an article to `postify-verified` when runtime freshness is stale or unknown. Article and compact badge UI explain re-check/unknown states instead of presenting a stale green claim.
- Production/fallback machine-readable knowledge artifacts now carry the same runtime-release signal as the UI. Build smoke and production smoke verify that the signal is structurally valid and bound to the exact execution runtime/major.
- Added a daily main CI schedule so runtime freshness and dependency-security gates refresh production even with no source-code push. Clients also expire runtime signals after 36 hours, so repeated schedule/deploy failures cannot leave a stale `current` badge indefinitely.
- Corrected stale `llms.txt` trust copy: Postify Verified is real checked-in deterministic execution with runtime freshness, explicitly not an arbitrary-code sandbox. Authenticated community confirmations vs anonymous device-local feedback and the 3-confirmation rate threshold are now described accurately; machine-readable trust artifact pointers were added.
- Runtime refresh emits GitHub Actions warnings for `recheck-required`/`unknown` without failing the deploy, so production can actually publish the downgraded trust state while maintainers still see the upgrade signal.
- Runtime signal tests cover exact-current LTS, newer patch, newer LTS major and unknown/fail-closed states. Independent fail-soft probe PASS when the Node release source is unreachable; independent live probe PASS as `current / v24.20.0 / Krypton` on 2026-08-28.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: Node 24.20.0 clean install + npm audit 0 + release-security parity + 23 Vitest files / 94 tests + lint/build/smoke; runtime artifact `current / v24.20.0 / maxAge=36h`; official Playwright 1.57 Chromium 23/23 PASS. The Playwright image executes on Node v24.11.1 and correctly emits `recheck-required -> v24.20.0`, proving the stale-runtime path without weakening browser coverage. Entry bundle remained ~303.4 KB under the 320 KB budget.

## 2026-08-28 — Publication/evidence readiness contract
- Split the editor's old single readiness percentage into three explicit surfaces: real publication eligibility, evidence claim status, and recommended quality signals.
- Publication readiness now mirrors the actual core submit rule: a valid trimmed title and minimum trimmed body. Missing outcome/evidence metadata no longer falsely marks an otherwise publishable post as blocked.
- The editor previews the exact persisted evidence claim: `Unverified` unless a non-future test date, meaningful environment entry, and meaningful verification step are present; then and only then it becomes `Author tested`. The payload uses the same helper instead of duplicating evidence-level logic.
- Meaningful evidence thresholds are fail-closed: environment requires at least one 3+ character trimmed entry; verification requires at least one 12+ character trimmed step. The author dashboard's re-verify action uses the same helper.
- Fixed date semantics: the date picker disallows future dates and test dates are persisted at the browser-local start of the selected day instead of fixed UTC noon, avoiding morning same-day writes being rejected as future timestamps.
- Removed misleading author copy that called every edited post “verified” or described structured-evidence persistence as “verified publishing.”
- Applied production migration `20260828185717_strengthen_author_tested_evidence.sql`. The DB integrity trigger and `reverify_post` now enforce the same meaningful evidence thresholds across non-UI write paths and reject weak re-verification before revision capture.
- Production preflight had 9 `unverified` posts and 0 `author-tested`, so the stricter trigger invalidated no existing production evidence. Production weak-environment/weak-verification smoke rejected both attempts and left the canonical Node post unchanged as `unverified` with `tested_at=null`.
- Exact local gates PASS: focused readiness tests 12/12 + lint; fresh PostgreSQL 16 full migration/RLS chain PASS; Node 24.20.0 clean install + npm audit 0 + release-security + full verify PASS; official Playwright 1.57 Chromium 23/23 PASS.
- Supabase advisor after apply: security ERROR 0; only the pre-existing leaked-password-protection WARN remains. Performance remains INFO-only unused-index observations.
- Modernized `project-context.md` and README so future loops and repository visitors no longer see stale “Supabase deferred / Node 20 / generic blog” assumptions.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 discovery masthead
- Started a dedicated `chatgpt/postify-ui-v3` branch so the redesign does not mix with the evidence-readiness release work.
- Installed Graphify repo-scoped and added a Postify UI Review skill that requires impact analysis, real-browser desktop/mobile inspection, accessibility checks, and rejects effect-first/template styling as a completion criterion.
- Reworked the first discovery viewport around an editorial knowledge-index hierarchy: calmer sticky header, masthead-scale value proposition, compact search/actions, featured knowledge presentation, restrained topic navigation, and a clearer segmented discovery filter.
- Removed one remaining app-shell decorative shadow and reduced competing visual weight instead of layering more effects onto the existing UI.
- Rebuilt the focused `src/` Graphify map after the change: 590 nodes / 1,273 edges / 32 communities.
- Exact UI V3 slice gates PASS: Node 24.20.0 23 Vitest files / 105 tests, lint, Vite production build (~303.7 KB main entry), and official Playwright 1.57 Chromium UI suite 24/24, including a new mobile feed-overflow regression check. Real 1440px and 390px home screenshots were reviewed; no horizontal overflow or blocking hierarchy defect was found.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 discovery feed
- Reworked the live `EditorialFeed` surface from image-led blog cards into a denser knowledge index: priority lead record, numbered rows, quieter thumbnails, compact actions and evidence-first metadata.
- Feed metadata now derives reading minutes through the shared presentation helper, so legacy posts without explicit `readingTime` no longer surface an undefined duration.
- Preserved category, format, freshness/evidence badge, community confirmation and bookmark behavior while reducing decorative card chrome and oversized imagery.
- Responsive QA: mobile document width is exact 390/390; each new feed article is 358/358 with no card overflow. The filter strip remains intentionally horizontally scrollable edge-to-edge.
- Validation PASS: 23 Vitest files / 105 tests, lint, production Vite build, and official Playwright 1.57 Chromium UI suite 24/24, including a new mobile feed-overflow regression check.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 article reader dossier
- Rebuilt the article detail surface as a quieter reader dossier instead of a stacked magazine/card composition: tighter title scale, compact author/meta, compressed quick brief, shallower cover, denser outline, sans-serif long-form body and flatter discussion/adjacent navigation.
- Surfaced the evidence/freshness badge in the article header before the H1 so readers can see the trust state before committing to the guidance; the full evidence panel and runbook remain intact below.
- Article reading time now uses the shared `getPostReadingMinutes` fallback, preventing legacy rows without explicit metadata from rendering an undefined duration in the rail or quick brief.
- Removed the legacy drop-cap and collapsed the accumulated V1/V2 CSS override layers into one coherent V3 stylesheet; every JSX CSS-module reference has a matching selector.
- Responsive QA: desktop article width is 820px; mobile article is 358px inside a 390px document with exact 390/390 document width. Trust metadata remains above the H1 and the mobile cover resolves to 16:9.
- Validation PASS: 23 Vitest files / 105 tests, lint, production Vite build, and official Playwright 1.57 Chromium UI suite 25/25 including trust-before-reading, mobile overflow and duration-fallback regression coverage.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 focused writing workspace
- Reordered Create/Edit around the author’s real task flow: choose a practical format, write the title/body first, then attach evidence. Evidence metadata no longer blocks the first writing interaction visually.
- Rebuilt the desktop editor as a wide writing column plus a calm sticky publication/trust inspector. Tablet and mobile collapse to one column with the readiness inspector before the writing fields, preserving context without horizontal overflow.
- Flattened the RichTextEditor chrome to match V3: restrained toolbar, editorial content surface, quieter focus states, technical-code treatment and no gradient/card-heavy shell.
- Browser QA used an isolated local-only route bypass that was reverted before validation/commit. Measured exact document widths at 1440/1440, 820/820 and 390/390 with zero page errors; body editor appears before evidence fields and the desktop inspector is genuinely sticky.
- QA exposed an existing Tiptap mount race: AI ghost-keyboard setup accessed `editor.view.dom` before EditorContent had mounted. The binding now targets the mounted `.ProseMirror` node through the editor wrapper and safely skips the effect until it exists.
- Added a dedicated RichTextEditor regression test proving the editor mounts safely while AI ghost completion is enabled.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 24 Vitest files / 106 tests, lint, production Vite build (main entry 303,604 bytes), and official Playwright 1.57 Chromium public UI suite 25/25.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 knowledge health console
- Rebuilt Knowledge Dashboard from a compressed admin-style list into a product-facing knowledge health console with a clear maintenance model: authored knowledge, needs-attention count, author-tested count and aggregate community signals.
- Added an explicit top-demand signal, re-verification queue, domain credibility track record and knowledge-gap demand map while preserving all existing author-only failure detail and re-verification behavior.
- Freshness states now use readable localized labels instead of exposing raw state tokens as the main UI copy; stale/unknown records are visually separated from current guidance without inventing a health score.
- Browser QA used a local-only protected-route bypass plus a mocked ready backend status and was fully reverted before commit. Responsive document widths were exact at 1440/1440, 820/820 and 390/390 with four core dashboard sections and zero page errors.
- Validation PASS: 24 Vitest files / 106 tests, lint, production Vite compile/PWA generation, and responsive browser structure QA.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 account knowledge surfaces
- Rebuilt Bookmarks as a personal knowledge shelf instead of a decorative card grid. Saved records now expose evidence state, format, reading cost, freshness/date context, outcome/summary and author linkage in a dense numbered index.
- Rebuilt public author pages as knowledge portfolios: removed banner/pattern/active-publisher decoration, surfaced published-record count, real derived reading minutes and author-tested record count, and reused the live V3 EditorialFeed for the author’s work.
- Rebuilt Profile as a focused account workspace with a calm identity header, flat editable fields and compact account metadata; removed the unused legacy danger/stats/gradient-card CSS layers entirely.
- Added Profile component regression coverage for both read and edit modes and added a public-author mobile E2E overflow/knowledge-portfolio contract.
- Populated Bookmarks browser QA used local-only Redux-persist seeding plus a temporary protected-route bypass; the bypass was reverted before release validation. Desktop/mobile document widths were exact at 1440/1440 and 390/390 with evidence/type/read-cost visible and no page errors.
- Public author browser QA passed at 1440/1440 and 390/390 with nine fallback knowledge records and zero page errors.
- Final release gates PASS: 25 Vitest files / 107 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 303,604 bytes), and official Chromium UI suite 26/26.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 auth surfaces and complete password recovery
- Rebuilt Login and Register from legacy glass/gradient cards into the V3 knowledge-account system: a product-context column explains why an account matters while the access form stays restrained and task-focused; mobile collapses to one clean column.
- Removed the old duplicated auth CSS override layers, colored glow shadows and glassmorphism. Both auth stylesheets now have exact JSX selector coverage with no unused page selectors.
- Found a real broken recovery chain during the visual audit: Login linked to `/auth/forgot-password`, and Supabase reset emails redirected to `/auth/reset-password`, but neither route existed. Added both public routes and a shared PasswordRecoveryPage that uses the existing `useAuth.resetPassword` and `useAuth.updatePassword` flows.
- Added localized recovery failure/success keys that were already referenced by the auth hook but missing from i18n.
- Added direct unit coverage for requesting a recovery email and completing a matching-password reset, plus a mobile Chromium contract proving both recovery routes render and do not overflow.
- Real browser QA on Login, Register, Forgot Password and Reset Password passed at 1440/1440 and 390/390 document widths with zero page errors.
- Final release gates PASS: 26 Vitest files / 109 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 304,189 bytes), and official Chromium UI suite 27/27.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 global knowledge navigation
- Rebuilt the global Footer as a single V3 knowledge-system surface instead of the legacy footer plus V2 override stack. The footer now makes Postify’s trust model explicit through Evidence, Freshness and Reproducibility and routes users back into knowledge discovery/authoring.
- Replaced pill-style category chrome with a numbered Topic Index rail that exposes the active topic, preserves URL-addressable category state and remains horizontally contained on mobile.
- Removed unused giant-footer banner styling and updated the footer product description so global chrome describes practical knowledge with evidence, freshness and execution context rather than generic editorial notes.
- Browser QA found and corrected an ARIA regression before release: custom `listitem` roles were removed so topic controls retain their native button semantics. Real-data QA confirmed 10 topic controls, state change to `Yapay zekâ`, URL synchronization, zero horizontal overflow and zero page errors at 390px.
- Tightened the mobile footer after browser measurement, reducing its rendered height from 1,273px to 1,057px while keeping the two content indexes readable and preserving exact 390/390 document width.
- Stabilized the password-recovery regression by waiting for the post-mutation React success render rather than only the mocked auth call; focused recovery coverage remains 2/2.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 26 Vitest files / 109 tests, source-only lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 305,219 bytes), and official Playwright 1.57 Chromium UI suite 29/29 including new Topic Index state and global Footer trust/mobile contracts.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 public system pages
- Rebuilt About as a product-contract page centered on Outcome, Evidence, Freshness and Reproducibility instead of a generic portfolio/about layout. The page now explains what Postify is optimizing for and how Guide / Decision / Explainer / Field Note formats map to practical work.
- Fixed a real navigation defect exposed by the redesign: the About authoring CTA pointed to nonexistent `/create`; it now targets the protected real route `/posts/create`.
- Rebuilt Contact as a correction-first public channel index. The page now prioritizes corrections, useful topic proposals and evidence-backed collaboration rather than generic contact-card decoration.
- Replaced the legacy 264-line animated/glowing 404 stack plus appended V2 override with one quiet V3 index-miss recovery surface and three format-aware recovery links. No gradient, blur, animation or box-shadow debt remains in the three public-system stylesheets.
- Updated stale Playwright contracts to the new public-system language and scoped the 404 primary CTA assertion to its own recovery surface so the identical global Footer CTA cannot create strict-mode ambiguity.
- Browser QA: About, Contact and 404 render without page errors at 1440px and 390px; mobile document width stays exact at 390/390. About exposes the real `/posts/create` href, Contact exposes correction/direct-channel rows, and 404 exposes its recovery index.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 26 Vitest files / 109 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 305,219 bytes), focused public-system Chromium 3/3, and full Chromium UI suite 29/29.

## 2026-08-28 — UI V3 dead decorative island cleanup
- Audited the remaining V1/V2 decorative component island by exact module-path import/re-export usage before deleting anything. BackgroundPaths, BentoGrid and its card variants, CustomCursor, GlowingCard, GradientBackground, MarqueeBanner, ParallaxImage, ScrollReveal, ShimmerButton, TextReveal, the old PostCard, its private Button/BookmarkButton chain, the standalone Skeleton component and the unused design-testimonial had no live production consumers.
- Removed 44 dead files / 2,724 lines. The old PostCard's 9 tests were removed with the component; the suite therefore moves from 109 to 100 live tests without losing coverage of production-reachable code. EditorialFeed's current bookmark control is a separate local implementation and remains intact.
- Post-delete dangling-import scan returned zero matches. 25 Vitest files / 100 live tests PASS, lint PASS, and production build PASS. The main entry remains exactly 305,219 bytes, confirming this island was not in the shipped dependency graph. Full Chromium UI suite also PASS at 29/29 after deletion, confirming the reachable browser flows are unchanged.

## 2026-08-29 — UI V3 evidence-aware knowledge card hierarchy
- Added one live `KnowledgeCard` primitive with explicit `featured`, `standard`, and `compact` variants instead of reviving the deleted Bento/V1 card stack. `EditorialFeed` now only orchestrates hierarchy: the first record is featured, the next three are standard, and later records become compact.
- Made the product contract scannable inside every live card: format/category/date metadata stays above the title, featured/standard cards expose an explicit Outcome, and the trust strip separates Evidence, Freshness, reading cost, execution/context environment, and community confirmation when available. Compact records reduce image/outcome density but keep evidence and freshness visible.
- Added direct component coverage for the 1 featured / 3 standard / remaining compact distribution plus Outcome / Evidence / Freshness / bookmark behavior. The live unit suite is now 26 Vitest files / 102 tests.
- Browser QA caught an internal desktop overflow that document-level checks would have missed: image `aspect-ratio` was forcing the featured/standard grid track beyond the card width. Constraining the image track with `minmax(0, 31%)`, `min-width: 0`, and `width: 100%` reduced max card overflow from 164px to 0.
- Real-data QA at 1440px and 390px confirmed 1 featured / 3 standard / 4 compact records, document overflow 0, max card overflow 0, max trust-strip overflow 0, and zero page errors.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 26 Vitest files / 102 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 305,818 bytes), focused card Chromium 1/1, recovery stability 5/5 after generated-artifact cleanup, and full Chromium UI suite 29/29 with retries disabled.

## 2026-08-29 — UI V3 deterministic screenshot-diff baselines
- Added a dedicated Playwright visual-regression configuration and six committed baselines covering Home, Article, and Editor at 1440px desktop and 390px mobile. The snapshot set is 2.7 MB total and captures the route-specific main surface rather than relying on failure-only screenshots.
- Made public baselines deterministic by starting the visual Vite server with Supabase environment variables explicitly unset, pinning language/theme to English/light, freezing browser time to 2026-08-29, disabling animations/transitions/carets, and waiting for fonts before capture. Home and Article therefore use the committed fallback knowledge catalogue rather than changing production records.
- Kept production authentication untouched. Editor visual coverage uses an `e2e/visual` harness that renders the real `CreatePostPage` with the real Redux and React Query providers, plus a fixed local draft that exercises writing, evidence, and readiness surfaces. No ProtectedRoute or auth bypass was added to shipped source.
- First baseline generation PASS 6/6; immediate comparison-only rerun PASS 6/6 without updating snapshots, proving deterministic output on the same Playwright 1.57 Chromium runtime.
- Production quality gates remain clean: 26 Vitest files / 102 tests PASS, lint PASS, production Vite/PWA build PASS, and the main entry remains exactly 305,818 bytes. The visual harness/config is test-only and does not enter the production dependency graph.

## 2026-08-29 — UI V3 visual regression promoted to release gate
- Promoted the deterministic six-snapshot Home / Article / Editor suite from a local QA tool into the `ui-e2e` GitHub Actions gate. CI runs it on a dedicated port after the functional Chromium suite and before the deploy job can become eligible.
- Removed the stale known issue claiming pixel baselines were not committed. The baseline set is committed, compare-only rerun is 6/6 PASS, lint PASS, and the production build remains 305,818 bytes.
- Visual CI uses the pinned Playwright 1.57 Chromium image already used by product E2E, with fixed language/theme/time and fallback public content, so release failures should represent real visual drift rather than changing production data.

## 2026-08-29 — Authenticated desktop account access restored
- Fixed a real post-login desktop navigation gap reported from production: authenticated users could create content and see bookmarks, but the desktop Header exposed neither the account/profile surface nor a logout action. Those controls previously existed only inside the mobile sheet.
- Added a compact authenticated account trigger that shows the user identity and opens a focused menu with Profile, Knowledge health, optional Admin, and Logout. The menu closes on route changes, outside pointer interaction, and Escape; narrower desktop widths collapse the trigger to its avatar without removing access.
- Added direct Header regression coverage for authenticated account visibility, profile/knowledge routes, logout dispatch, Escape dismissal, and signed-out absence.
- Added a test-only authenticated Header visual harness and committed desktop screenshot baseline so future visual regressions cannot silently remove the account affordance again.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 27 Vitest files / 105 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 307,812 bytes, under the 320 KB budget), functional Chromium 29/29, and deterministic visual regression 7/7.

## 2026-08-29 — Profile dashboard redesign
- Rebuilt `/profile` from a sparse identity page into a dense account/creator dashboard based on the approved visual direction.
- Added balanced identity + account-actions hero, real membership/role/post/bookmark stats, account summary, content production, saved knowledge, knowledge-health cards, and quick-access workspace links.
- Kept all actions wired to existing real routes/data (`/users/:id`, `/posts/create`, `/bookmarks`, `/knowledge`) instead of inventing settings/draft surfaces that do not exist.
- Preserved the existing profile edit/avatar workflow inside a focused expandable editor panel and added a direct logout action.
- Added authenticated profile visual harness + desktop/mobile deterministic screenshot baselines and horizontal-overflow assertions.
- QA: 27 test files / 106 unit tests PASS, lint PASS, production build PASS (main entry 307,812 bytes), Chromium functional 29/29 PASS, visual regression 9/9 PASS.
- Browser layout measurement: desktop main profile content 922px high with 2-column hero + 4-column dashboard; tablet dashboard 2-column; mobile single-column; document overflow 0 at 1440/820/390 widths.

## 2026-08-29 — browser-led route audit and account/admin polish
- Ran a real Chromium route audit across Home, Login, Register, Forgot/Reset password, About, Contact, 404 recovery, Article and public Author at 1440px, 820px and 390px. The audit checked document overflow, section spacing, H1 scale, broken images, console/page errors and fixed/sticky chrome. No page-level overflow or broken-image regression was found.
- Normalized the most over-scaled public editorial surfaces after the browser pass: About, Contact and public Author now use a tighter desktop type/spacing scale while preserving the existing mobile hierarchy. Added committed desktop/mobile visual baselines for all three.
- Rebuilt the remaining legacy Admin visual layer as a single V3 operations console: removed the old shadow/indigo card stack plus appended V2 overrides, added contained mobile table wrappers, clearer tab semantics and a denser stats/recency layout.
- Fixed three Admin data-contract defects discovered during UI inspection: dashboard admin/moderator/recent-user fields are now actually returned; flat profile fields are rendered correctly instead of nonexistent `user_metadata`; moderation rows now resolve author profiles instead of falling back to `Anonim` for known authors.
- Removed the misleading user-delete affordance because the current service intentionally rejects client-side account deletion; the UI now states that a secure server-side Admin API is required instead of presenting a destructive control that can never succeed.
- Aligned Bookmarks and Knowledge Health with the denser Profile account-workspace scale and added deterministic populated-state visual harnesses for both. Knowledge Health gained test-only data overrides so the real component can be rendered in Chromium without weakening production auth or depending on live database content.
- Expanded deterministic visual regression from 9 to 22 browser contracts: Home/Article/Editor, authenticated Header/Profile, About/Contact/Author, Admin desktop/mobile + mobile table containment, populated Bookmarks and Knowledge Health.
- Final exact-worktree gates PASS: 28 Vitest files / 108 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build (main entry 307,812 bytes), functional Chromium 29/29 and visual regression 22/22.
- CI caught one deterministic-visual weakness before deploy: the public Author mobile test was capturing the entire ~3.5k-pixel async feed and could vary in total height during settling. The contract now screenshots the fixed first viewport after waiting for the first knowledge record, preserving the visible author/header/feed hierarchy while removing irrelevant full-page height jitter. The updated Author baseline passed three consecutive compare-only runs and the full 22-test visual suite.

## 2026-08-29 — UI V3 browser audit: auth, article and editor controls
- Audited production Login, Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password, 404 and Article at 1440/1024/820/390 in real Chromium. Route-level horizontal overflow stayed at zero, but the audit exposed oversized auth context typography, undersized touch controls, missing programmatic validation linkage, and an unnamed mobile theme control.
- Reduced auth context heading scale from 100.8px desktop / 88px tablet / 58.5px mobile to 72px / 65.6px / 46.8px while preserving zero route overflow.
- Linked Login/Register/Recovery validation errors to their inputs with `aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby`, gave the mobile theme button an accessible name, and raised mobile auth/header utility controls to a 44px touch target.
- Real Chromium on the Editor harness exposed a genuine 390px containment defect: the sticky publish action row bled 24px beyond the form and toolbar controls extended past the viewport. Removed the negative mobile action bleed; form/internal overflow is now zero. The rich-text toolbar remains intentionally horizontally scrollable but its mobile controls are 44px.
- Raised Article bookmark/share/community/code-copy controls and the footer back-to-top utility to touch-safe mobile sizes without expanding the document.
- Expanded the functional Chromium suite from 29 to 31 tests and deterministic visual release coverage from 22 to 32 tests, adding Login/Register/Forgot/Reset/404 desktop+mobile baselines and explicit editor mobile containment/touch assertions.
- Final local release gates PASS: 28 Vitest files / 108 tests, lint, production Vite/PWA build, functional Chromium 31/31, visual regression 32/32. Main entry is 307,867 bytes, below the 320 KB budget.
## 2026-08-29 — Production screenshot-led UI V3 route audit
- Audited the live production UI in real Playwright Chromium at 1440px desktop and 390px mobile, starting from Home and continuing through Login, Register, About, Contact, the canonical Article, public Author and 404. Protected Profile, Bookmarks, Knowledge, Editor and Admin routes were first verified to redirect to Login in production, then their real components were audited through the existing deterministic authenticated visual harnesses rather than weakening production auth.
- Home was tightened only after before/after full-page screenshots were visually reviewed: desktop height moved 4371→4119px before the later footer pass; mobile moved 5192→4846px, with a calmer hero, stronger Topic Index/type navigation and less repetitive mobile trust metadata. The global mobile Footer was reduced from roughly 1114px to ~970px while preserving 44px interactive targets.
- Login/Register no longer reserve an artificial viewport-height dead zone; their forms now read as contained account panels. Article reading now begins before the detailed evidence/runbook appendix: first real body content moved from y=2595→1451 desktop and y=2733→1225 mobile while all evidence remains available below the article.
- Mobile account/work surfaces were made denser without deleting information: public Author 4723→4289px, authenticated Profile 3750→3275px, Knowledge Health 2660→2439px with the maintenance queue y=929→708, and Editor title/content moved from y=1285/1430 to y=726/871 by keeping writing modes 2×2 and moving readiness after the drafting/evidence flow. Bookmarks, Admin, About, Contact and the designed 404 recovery page were intentionally left structurally unchanged after screenshot review because they did not show a comparable hierarchy/spacing defect.
- Chromium caught one sub-pixel accessibility regression in the Command Palette close target (43.83px); the mobile control is now 46px. Final local gates: 28 Vitest files / 108 tests PASS, lint PASS, production build/smoke PASS (308,058-byte main entry, below 320KB), functional Chromium 32/32 PASS, and deterministic visual regression compare-only 38/38 PASS after reviewing and updating only intentional baselines.
- Production deep links still report the known initial GitHub Pages HTTP 404 before the checked SPA fallback restores the requested route; this is a hosting boundary, not a React rendering failure, and no hosting/auth bypass was introduced to mask it.
- First hosted CI attempt correctly blocked deploy after two transient mobile visual diffs (Login and Auth Callback) despite 36/38 visual passes. A clean detached checkout in the exact Playwright 1.57 CI image with fresh `npm ci` reproduced 38/38 PASS. The visual harness now waits for auth hydration before capturing form-based auth routes and disables animation/transition properties outright before two animation frames; the exact CI image then passed compare-only 38/38 again without baseline changes.
- A second hosted run moved the sole visual failure from Login/Auth Callback to Forgot Password mobile while 37/38 contracts passed, confirming the full-viewport public-system mobile PNGs were runner-sensitive rather than route-specific regressions. Six public-system mobile PNG baselines were therefore replaced with deterministic 390px layout contracts that fail on horizontal overflow, clipped H1 geometry, pre-hydration auth forms, sub-44px form controls, or controls escaping the viewport. Their six desktop pixel baselines remain; core Home/Article/Editor/Profile/Author/Knowledge/Admin/Bookmarks mobile pixel baselines remain unchanged. The exact Playwright 1.57 CI image passed the revised 38-test suite twice consecutively.
- Stress-testing the new 390px public-system layout contract exposed one locator-detach race in 60 repetitions: React could replace the Login heading between `toBeVisible()` and Playwright `boundingBox()`. Geometry/touch measurements are now captured atomically from one DOM snapshot via `getBoundingClientRect()`. The revised contract passed 60/60 stress iterations plus two consecutive full 38/38 visual runs in the pinned Playwright 1.57 CI image.
- 2026-08-30 recovery-surface follow-up: live Forgot/Reset screenshots showed the pre-audit auth layout still retained an artificial viewport min-height and lacked the Login/Register panel treatment. PasswordRecoveryPage now shares the tighter auth grid/padding, elevated bordered card, 48px input/primary-action sizing and compact mobile spacing. Real Chromium measurements: Forgot desktop 2029→1677px, Reset desktop 2029→1749px; mobile remains 390px overflow-free with 50px inputs, 48px submit actions and 44px password toggle. Clean fresh-install gates PASS: 28 files / 108 unit tests, lint, production build/smoke (307,954-byte main entry), functional Chromium 32/32 and visual suite 38/38.
- 2026-08-30 route-inventory closure: App.jsx route enumeration confirmed every public route and protected surface had been audited except the distinct `/posts/:id/edit` render mode. Added a deterministic edit-knowledge harness that loads a real fallback post through the existing `usePost` path, verifies edit-specific hydration (`Edit knowledge`, populated title, `What changed?`) and captures desktop/mobile baselines. Full visual release coverage is now 40/40 PASS, including mobile editor containment.
## 2026-08-30 — Local Markdown import/export
- Added browser-local `.md` / `.markdown` import and export to Create/Edit using `@tiptap/markdown@3.16.0`, matching the existing Tiptap 3.16 stack rather than maintaining a custom regex/HTML converter. No Markdown file is uploaded to Postify.
- Import promotes the first leading H1 to the Postify title, loads the remaining Markdown through Tiptap's document model, limits files to 1 MB, and requires confirmation before replacing a non-empty title/body. Evidence, verification status and provenance fields are never inferred from imported text.
- Export serializes the live Tiptap document back to Markdown, prepends the current title as H1 and downloads a filesystem-safe `.md` filename. A real Chromium round-trip exposed a Turkish-locale `I → ı` filename bug (`Imported` became `mported`); the slugger now normalizes `İ/I/ı` before locale-independent lowercasing and has regression coverage.
- Real 1440/390 Chromium review moved Import/Export out of the masthead and into the existing writing-tools row so portability controls do not push the primary writing task down the page. At 390px both controls are 44px, document overflow is zero, and the title input remains around y=757 rather than the ~814px seen in the rejected masthead variant.
- Release gates on a fresh temp mirror PASS: security audit 0 vulnerabilities; 29 Vitest files / 113 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with 307,954-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 32/32; deterministic visual suite 41/41 including a real file-import/download-export round trip. The Markdown dependency grows only the lazy Editor chunk (~415.8 KB minified / ~127.6 KB gzip); the main entry is unchanged.
- Canonical URL support is intentionally not marked complete and remains a separate persistence/SEO task.

## 2026-08-30 — Canonical source URL capability
- Added additive `canonical_source_url` schema support with HTTP/HTTPS, trim and 2048-character database checks; the complete 11-migration PostgreSQL 16 chain plus Verified Knowledge RLS/abuse verification passes from a fresh database.
- Added canonical provenance to Create/Edit, post persistence, article SEO and machine-readable knowledge export while preserving the Postify article URL as the share/Open Graph URL. Invalid or script/data URLs are rejected.
- Made canonical persistence separately capability-gated. If production has not applied the new column, public reads use the existing Verified Knowledge field set, author writes omit the column, and the editor does not expose a non-working control. A dedicated 390px Chromium contract opens the capability explicitly and verifies validation, 44px touch height and zero document overflow.
- Clean mirror release gates PASS: security audit 0 vulnerabilities; 30 Vitest files / 115 tests; lint; build/smoke with 308,892-byte main entry under budget; functional Chromium 32/32; visual/structural suite 42/42.
- Migration-only commit `0f6ac4f` passed hosted CI, deploy and production smoke. Production schema apply remains blocked only by missing GitHub Actions management secrets (`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`); dry-run stopped before linking or touching Supabase.

## 2026-08-30 — Mobile interaction geometry audit
- Extended the screenshot-led UI V3 pass from route layouts into interactive mobile geometry across public and authenticated surfaces at 390px. Real Chromium measurements found undersized actions that route screenshots did not expose: Home/Author bookmark controls (32px), Home read/actions and filters (38–42px), Bookmarks actions (38px), Knowledge Health maintenance actions (38px), Editor metadata controls (~39–43px), Admin role/post controls (34–36px), and auth recovery/navigation links (~14–20px).
- Raised those interactive targets to at least 44px without changing desktop density. Article author/artifact actions were aligned to the same mobile target while runbook checkboxes were intentionally left unchanged because their full label hit areas already measure ~358×48px.
- Added accessible names to Admin role/post controls and restored the Radix mobile Sheet close button, which had been globally hidden. The Postify drawer now has a visible localized 44×44 `Close menu / Menüyü kapat` action and a Chromium open→close regression contract.
- Re-probed the changed surfaces after CSS updates: Home, public Author and Article primary actions measure 44px; Bookmarks, Knowledge Health, Editor/Create/Edit and Admin have no visible actionable control below 44px (excluding the intentionally hidden 1×1 file input); auth account-navigation links pass the 390px layout contract. Zero-result actions remain ~50px and Command Palette results/close remain ~63px/~46px; its 26px input is retained because the focusable label wrapper is the full ~54px hit area.
- Updated only the six intentionally changed mobile visual baselines (Home, Article, Editor, Edit knowledge, Bookmarks, Knowledge Health); an immediate compare-only rerun passed 7/7 including the unchanged Profile editor control.

## 2026-08-30 — UI state audit: overlays, empty data, recovery and missing authors
- Promoted two interaction states that route screenshots previously missed into deterministic visual contracts: the 390px mobile navigation drawer with its explicit close action, and the mobile Command Palette with focused search, 44px+ close control and 44px+ result options. Both new snapshots passed immediate compare-only reruns.
- Added real-component empty/unavailable harnesses for Bookmarks and Knowledge Health. The first pass caught the Bookmarks empty-state recovery CTA at 42px; it is now 44px. Desktop/mobile empty Bookmarks and backend-unavailable Knowledge baselines pass compare-only 4/4.
- Audited Admin no-data and failure states through injected deterministic services. Empty dashboard/recent-users, empty users and empty posts now communicate their state instead of rendering blank lists/table chrome. Load failures expose a 44px Retry action; the browser contract verifies failure → retry → successful empty dashboard recovery. The full new Admin state set passes compare-only.
- Fixed a public-author correctness/UX bug uncovered while making the not-found state reachable: arbitrary or missing user identifiers no longer impersonate the fallback Postify editor. Only explicit fallback aliases resolve to that author; unknown routes resolve to the designed Author-not-found recovery surface. Added three service regressions plus desktop/mobile visual baselines.
- Split public Author route-level and in-feed loading styles so a transient posts load no longer inherits the old 50vh route-status block. The missing-author surface now has an indexed recovery treatment and 44px return action consistent with other V3 system pages.
- Ran a 390px browser geometry scan across Home, auth, Article, Author/missing Author, Bookmarks/empty, Knowledge/unavailable, Editor/Create/Edit, Profile, Admin/empty/error and 404. No visible button/select/input remains below 44px except native inputs whose wrapping labels are the real hit surface (Home search 50px label; runbook checkboxes ~48.4px labels).

## 2026-08-30 — Keyboard and focus audit
- Extended UI acceptance beyond screenshots and touch geometry into keyboard/focus behavior on the real Chromium component tree. The mobile Radix drawer already trapped focus and closed on Escape, but because it is opened as a controlled Sheet without a Radix trigger its close path returned focus to `body`; Header now explicitly restores focus to the menu trigger on close.
- Corrected Admin tab semantics instead of leaving `role="tab"` as decoration: only the active tab is in the normal tab order, ArrowLeft/ArrowRight wrap across tabs, Home/End jump to the first/last tab, focus activates the corresponding panel, and the tab/panel relationship is exposed with `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby`.
- Reworked Command Palette keyboard semantics around an actual combobox/listbox contract. Search keeps DOM focus, ArrowUp/Down changes `aria-activedescendant`, results are removed from the Tab sequence while remaining pointer-clickable, Tab cycles only between the search and Close control, and Escape still restores the element that opened search.
- Reclassified the authenticated desktop account popover as an expanded disclosure with ordinary links/buttons rather than advertising unsupported ARIA menu keyboard behavior. Its existing Escape dismissal remains intact.
- Added the missing accessible name to the Article mobile bookmark icon action. A Chromium accessibility-tree scan across Home, Article, Editor, Profile, Admin and Login found no remaining visible unnamed focusable controls.
- Existing skip-link/runbook keyboard contracts remain in place. Targeted Chromium checks for drawer focus restoration, Command Palette focus trap/active descendant, Admin tab arrow navigation and the Article mobile action all pass.

## 2026-08-30 — Contrast and author-failure-state audit
- Ran computed-style contrast scans in real Chromium across Home, Login, Article, Author, Bookmarks, Knowledge Health, Editor, Profile and Admin in both light and dark themes. The audit found a global light-theme contrast debt: `--text-muted` was roughly 3.27–3.76:1 on Postify surfaces, success green about 2.09:1 and warning yellow about 1.76:1 in normal-size labels.
- Rebalanced shared light tokens to readable editorial tones (`--text-muted #6f6860`, success `#166534`, warning `#854d0e`, error `#b91c1c`) and raised dark `--text-muted` to `#938b83` while retaining the existing brighter dark semantic colors. A post-fix Chromium scan reports zero low-contrast visible-text candidates across the audited light/dark route set.
- Chromium also exposed a real cascade bug in the verified Article code block: global inline `code` styling painted a light tertiary background inside the dark `pre`, leaving the light code text nearly unreadable. `CopyableCodeBlock` now explicitly contains its code styling; the measured code contrast is release-gated at >=4.5:1. The execution SHA inline code is promoted from muted to secondary text on its tertiary chip.
- Marked Hero metadata middle-dot separators as decorative so their intentionally faint presentation is not announced as content.
- Tightened public Author correctness further: a successful missing profile remains a not-found state, but profile-service/query failures now propagate into a separate retryable “temporarily unavailable” surface instead of being misreported as a missing author. Published-work query failures use a separate inline retry state once the author identity is known. Added unit coverage plus deterministic desktop/mobile harnesses for both failure levels.
- Added release contracts for light/dark core token contrast and verified code-block contrast.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 31 Vitest files / 119 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 309,052-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 32/32; deterministic visual/structural suite 62/62. The 51 committed PNG baselines were force-refreshed against the accessible token system and then passed a compare-only 62/62 rerun before the fresh gate.

## 2026-08-30 — Dark-theme visual parity, discussion controls and dead Analytics cleanup
- Promoted dark mode from a token-only contrast check to deterministic rendered release coverage. Added desktop/mobile dark baselines for Home, Article, Create Editor, authenticated Profile, Bookmarks, Knowledge Health and Admin. Existing light baselines remained unchanged after correcting a standalone Editor harness timing artifact; the live-surface visual suite is now 80 contracts and passes compare-only 80/80 after dead CommentSection coverage was removed.
- Route tracing showed the old interactive `CommentSection` was not mounted anywhere: the live Article reads public comments through `postService`/`commentService` and renders its own discussion surface. Removed the dead CommentSection/useComments layer instead of promoting unused UI into the release baseline. The same route-reference audit removed unused ShareButtons, ImageUpload/useImageUpload and useInfiniteScroll layers; live CopyLinkButton sharing, public comment reading and Profile avatar storage paths remain intact.
- Removed the unreachable legacy AnalyticsPage implementation after confirming App.jsx has no `/analytics` route and no production import references. Removed the chart-only `recharts` dependency, reducing a clean npm install from 868 to 829 packages (39 fewer), and removed the obsolete Analytics navigation assertion while modernizing the remaining optional navigation suite to the current root-hosted routes.
- Dark visual initialization now distinguishes production App hydration from standalone harnesses: localStorage drives real App/Profile theme state, while harness-only pages receive `data-theme` after navigation. This avoids generating a false dark Editor baseline with a 64–66px layout-height drift caused solely by pre-parser test timing.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: clean `npm ci` installed 828 packages / audited 829 with 0 vulnerabilities; release-security and deterministic knowledge checks passed; 31 Vitest files / 119 tests, lint, production build/smoke, updated navigation 3/3, functional Chromium 32/32 and visual/structural Chromium 80/80 all passed. Main entry fell from 309,052 to 307,694 bytes and remains below the 320 KB budget.

## 2026-08-30 — English taxonomy parity and fallback author correctness
- Real production Chromium review found mixed-language taxonomy in English mode: backend category values such as `Ürün tasarımı`, `Geliştirici araçları`, `İş akışı`, `Performans` and `Altyapı` leaked into Topic Index, knowledge cards and search/result metadata. Added a locale-aware display-label layer while keeping stored/filter category values stable; localized labels also participate in search so English queries can match Turkish canonical category values.
- Fixed the public fallback-author alias contract. `/users/postify` resolved the profile identity but `postService.getByUserId()` passed the alias through to a stricter fallback lookup, producing `0 published records`. Explicit aliases now share one normalization path, return all 9 fallback records, and fallback author name/bio are localized (`Postify Editor` in English) without impersonating arbitrary missing users.
- Made public-user React Query keys locale-aware so a language switch cannot reuse a profile identity/bio from the previous locale. Updated the deterministic author-posts-error harness to seed the same locale-aware query key used by production code.
- Expanded dark-theme release coverage to Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Auth Callback, About, Contact and public Author at desktop/mobile widths. Only intentional Home/Author/Command Palette language changes and the new dark snapshots were refreshed; the targeted compare-only set passed 17/17.
- Investigated an intermittent Home-mobile visual readiness failure instead of rerunning until green. The Oracle host had multiple stale Postify audit Vite/Playwright containers still mounting `/opt/postify-dev`; only those temporary Postify containers were stopped, leaving Hava81/Nexus and unrelated services untouched. After cleanup, 30 independent 390px Chromium contexts rendered the Home featured record 30/30 in 837–981 ms (885 ms average).
- Final fresh-mirror release gate after cleanup PASS: clean `npm ci` audited 829 packages with 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 309,546-byte main entry below the 320 KB budget; navigation 3/3; functional Chromium 33/33; visual/structural Chromium 94/94.

## 2026-08-30 — UI closeout: localization, overlays and narrow-screen stress
- Completed the post-route UI closeout with real Chromium rather than source inspection alone. Admin is now fully locale-aware in English and Turkish across headings, tabs, tables, roles, status/empty/error states, dates, confirmation copy and accessible labels; action failures use the shared Postify toast surface instead of browser alerts.
- Fixed a real scrolled-page Command Palette defect: opening `Ctrl+K` around `scrollY=700` could place the fixed dialog roughly 629px above the viewport because it lived under the sticky/backdrop-filter Header context. The palette now portals to `document.body`, locks background scrolling without moving the body, remains inside the viewport, and restores both scroll position and initiating focus on dismissal.
- Closed remaining locale/accessibility leaks in the Editor and auth flow: rich-text toolbar controls now expose localized accessible names and pressed state, AI/unsaved/revision copy follows the active language, and OAuth callback/error messaging has native EN/TR translations instead of Turkish fallback strings.
- Raised the Article table-of-contents and evidence-source links to 44px effective mobile targets and made the floating Article action rail retire before it can cover the Footer. 320/390px light+dark probes confirmed 44px targets and zero footer overlap.
- Ran a final 96-combination public route × width × theme scanner plus long-string, keyboard-focus and Turkish-mobile stress. No actionable overflow, escaped control, unnamed focus target, broken image or language leak remained; the only scanner hits are the deliberate two-line Outcome clamp on compact knowledge rows.
- Investigated rather than reran a Home visual-readiness flake. Fifty independent desktop Chromium contexts rendered the featured card 50/50 with p95 868ms, p99 895ms and 908ms max. The visual gate now waits up to 15s for the meaningful Home marker before pixel capture without changing screenshot tolerance; the exact visual harness then passed Home light/dark desktop/mobile 40/40 repeated runs.
- Final fresh-mirror release gates PASS: clean `npm ci` audited 829 packages with 0 vulnerabilities; deterministic knowledge/runtime verification; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; production build/smoke with a 310,093-byte main entry below the 320KB budget; release security; functional Chromium 34/34; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 98/98.

## 2026-08-30 — Screenshot-driven Home density and format-navigation repair
- Reworked the live Home composition against the user's 1304px Chrome screenshots instead of a synthetic mock: reduced the poster-like hero height, tightened masthead/supporting spacing, balanced the featured story image/copy ratio, reduced feed-card vertical padding and simplified trust-strip separators so the first useful records arrive sooner without weakening the editorial hierarchy.
- Simplified the Topic Index and format/evidence rail by removing per-cell divider noise and using spacing, tone and a compact active treatment instead. The same card-density changes were verified on the public Author portfolio because it shares the EditorialFeed/KnowledgeCard system.
- Fixed the top `Explore / Guides / Decisions / Field notes` interaction contract. The old links already changed the `type` query, but the Header kept Explore visually active and the viewport stayed at the top of the large hero, making the click appear to do nothing. Format links now own an `aria-current` active state, include `#knowledge-feed`, and Home aligns the selected feed below the sticky header. Explore and the Postify logo clear the filtered navigation context and return to the top.
- Added the same canonical format links and active semantics to the mobile drawer. Decorative numeric indices are hidden from accessible names so `Guides`, `Decisions` and `Field notes` remain clean screen-reader targets.
- Real Chromium matrix PASS across 320/390/820/1304/1440 widths in both light and dark themes: format selection, drawer close, query/hash, visible filtered feed, Explore reset and document horizontal overflow all reported zero findings. At 1304–1440px the hero is now about 515–540px tall and the first feed starts around 661–686px; the desktop Home visual baseline shrank from 2871px to 2668px overall.
- Only the expected 8 Home/Author light/dark desktop/mobile screenshots plus the mobile drawer snapshot were refreshed; each targeted set passed compare-only immediately after refresh.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: clean npm install audited 829 packages with 0 vulnerabilities; deterministic knowledge and release-security checks; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; production build/smoke with a 310,900-byte main entry below the 320KB budget; functional Chromium 36/36; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 98/98.

## 2026-08-30 — Footer navigation and tablet touch-mode closure
- Continued the browser-led UI audit below the previously covered 390/1440 widths. A live production Chromium reproduction found Footer format navigation still using `/?type=...` without the Home feed hash: from the bottom of Home, `Guides / Rehberler` changed the filter but left the reader far below the filtered feed (about 1,563px above the viewport at 390px and 1,180px above it at 1304px). Footer format links now use the same `#knowledge-feed` contract as Header navigation, while the Footer knowledge CTA and brand link explicitly reset Home and return to the top.
- Removed decorative Footer index numbers from accessible link names so screen readers announce `Guides`, `Decisions`, `About`, etc. instead of `01 Guides`, `02 Decisions`, matching the cleaned mobile Header navigation.
- Extended the interaction audit into the 600–960px tablet range because Header already switches to its touch/drawer navigation at <=960px. Chromium found controls that were 44px at phone width but fell back to desktop geometry on tablets: Home filters (40px), knowledge-card bookmarks (32px), Bookmarks maintenance actions (38px), Knowledge Health actions (38px), Profile dashboard/editor actions (40px), Editor transfer/evidence/publish controls (~39–43px), RichTextEditor toolbar controls (30px), and Footer navigation/actions (18–40px).
- Added touch-only <=960px rules without changing layout reflow breakpoints or 1440 desktop density. Post-fix EN/TR Chromium scans across 600/820/960 public and authenticated harness surfaces report no small visible button/input/select controls; the Home search input remains intentionally compact because its wrapping label is the real 50px+ hit surface.
- Added permanent release contracts for Footer bottom-of-page format navigation/top reset, 600/820/960 Footer touch geometry, and 820/960 primary work-surface controls. Targeted Chromium checks pass 2/2 functional + 1/1 tablet structural before the full release gate.

## 2026-08-30 — Keyboard context and reduced-motion route polish
- Continued the live Chromium audit after the tablet/Footer release. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` exposed a real programmatic-scroll gap: Footer “Back to top / Başa dön” still animated for roughly half a second because CSS `scroll-behavior` does not override `window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' })`. The handler now switches to `auto` under the user’s reduced-motion preference while normal mode retains smooth scrolling; a deterministic Chromium contract verifies the reduced-motion path reaches `scrollY=0` immediately.
- Found two focus-context regressions that pixel baselines could not reveal. Escaping the authenticated account popover while focus was on `Profile` removed the focused child and dropped focus to `body`; Escape now restores focus to the account trigger. Separately, SPA pathname navigation from persistent Footer links scrolled the new route to the top but left focus on the now-offscreen old Footer link; genuine pathname changes now focus `#main-content` without stealing focus during Home query/hash format filtering.
- Real Chromium verification covers 390/1304 pathname transitions, 1181/1440 account-popover Escape behavior, normal-vs-reduced-motion back-to-top timing, plus a 39-surface tablet keyboard sweep (13 public/authenticated routes × 600/820/960) with zero missing-focus or horizontal-focus-escape findings. Long account-name/email stress at 1181/1280/1440 in light/dark also reports zero clipping or viewport overflow.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,420-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 40/40; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 99/99. No screenshot baseline refresh was required.

## 2026-08-30 — Short-height overlay containment
- Extended the real-production browser audit into landscape/short-height viewports (844×390, 667×375 and 568×320). The mobile drawer already contained itself correctly with internal vertical scrolling, but Command Palette exceeded the viewport bottom by roughly 82–115px because its vertical padding, results cap and keyboard-hint Footer were tuned only for normal-height screens.
- Added a compact-height overlay mode at <=520px viewport height: reduced outer vertical padding, capped the scrollable results area by viewport height and removed the non-essential keyboard-hint Footer. Tablet/touch Command Palette close geometry is now 46px so the opening scale animation never shrinks the effective hit area below 44px.
- Added a deterministic Chromium structural contract that exercises all three short viewports in one run, waits for the real Home readiness marker before invoking Ctrl+K, asserts full dialog containment and >=44px close geometry, then verifies Escape dismissal. Targeted official visual-config run passes 1/1 without changing any screenshot baseline.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,420-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 40/40; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 100/100. Existing screenshot baselines remained unchanged.

## 2026-08-30 — Floating article tools and keyboard focus visibility
- Audited every fixed/sticky product surface and then exercised the Article floating mobile tool bar through real Tab navigation at 844×390, 667×375 and 568×320. The bar itself stayed inside the viewport, but in short landscape screens it physically overlapped focused article/evidence controls such as the verification link, local evidence-state buttons and adjacent-story links.
- Kept the touch affordance instead of hiding the bar: while keyboard focus is visibly on another control inside the Article, the floating bar now uses the same retreat transition as its Footer-visibility state; when Tab reaches the bar’s own Back/Bookmark/Comments/Copy controls it becomes visible again. Pointer/touch reading behavior is unchanged and Bookmark remains reachable.
- A deterministic Chromium structural contract verifies the 568×320 keyboard path: external focus hides/disables the overlay, focus entering the bar restores it, and the focused Back target preserves its 44px effective geometry. Targeted official visual-config run passes 1/1 without screenshot drift.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 121 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,420-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 40/40; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 101/101. Existing screenshot baselines remained unchanged.

## 2026-08-30 — Editor validation semantics and focus recovery
- Real Chromium submission testing exposed an accessibility gap in the TipTap body field: the visible `Content / İçerik` label did not programmatically name the contenteditable surface, body validation was not announced as an alert, and an invalid submit left keyboard focus on the distant Publish button.
- RichTextEditor now accepts external validation semantics and applies them to the actual `.ProseMirror` contenteditable node (`aria-labelledby`, dynamic `aria-invalid`, and `aria-describedby`). The Create Editor connects the content label, validation message and live word/read-time counter to that surface; body errors are announced with `role=alert`.
- The editor imperative API now exposes `focus()`. After validation renders, invalid submit moves focus to the first invalid field: Title first, then the rich-text body, then canonical source when applicable. Real 390px Chromium verification confirms empty submit focuses Title and a valid-title/empty-body submit focuses the TipTap editor with the error relationship intact.
- Targeted regression checks PASS: RichTextEditor unit suite 3/3 and deterministic Chromium editor-validation contract 1/1.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 122 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,420-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 40/40; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 102/102. Existing screenshot baselines remained unchanged.

## 2026-08-30 — Auth validation focus and field-specific recovery errors
- Real production Chromium audit showed Login, Register and Password Recovery already exposed visible alerts and `aria-invalid`, but invalid submission left keyboard focus on the submit button instead of the first field requiring correction. Login now focuses Email, Register focuses Full name, and Recovery request focuses Account email after validation renders.
- Password reset previously used one shared error string, which marked both password inputs invalid even when only one needed correction. Recovery validation now tracks the responsible field: short passwords mark/focus only New password, while a mismatch marks/focuses only Confirm new password. Editing the affected field clears only its own validation error.
- Extended the existing functional Chromium auth contract to verify focus recovery on Login/Register/Recovery plus field-specific reset-password invalid semantics. Added unit coverage for invalid recovery email, short reset password and mismatch routing. After rebuilding the production preview used by the functional config, targeted Recovery unit tests pass 4/4 and targeted Chromium auth/recovery tests pass 2/2.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 124 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,420-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 40/40; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 102/102. Existing screenshot baselines remained unchanged.

## 2026-08-30 — Dead AI presentation surface cleanup
- Audited the AI assistant presentation exports after the UI closeout passes. `AISettings`, `GhostText`, and `GhostTextOverlay` had zero live consumers outside their own barrel files; the active editor uses `useAICompletion` plus its own inline ghost suggestion surface instead.
- Removed the unreachable AI settings/ghost presentation components and their CSS/index files while preserving the runtime AI hook, service, Redux slice, and editor integration. This also removes a stale hard-coded Turkish settings panel and an unreachable browser-confirm flow from the live source tree.
- Fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 124 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; build/smoke; functional Chromium 40/40; visual/structural Chromium 102/102. Existing screenshot baselines did not move.
- Build graph materially simplified: Vite transformed 476 modules after cleanup versus 877 before cleanup. Main entry remains within the 320 KB budget at 311,420 bytes; no runtime feature was removed.

## 2026-08-30 — Mobile toast clearance above Article tools
- Real production Chromium found a feedback-layer collision that width/overflow tests did not catch: after bookmarking an Article, the settled bottom-right toast physically overlapped the fixed mobile Article toolbar at 390×844 and 568×320. At 390px the overlap area was about 2,513px²; at 568×320 it was about 912px². The 820px surface was already separated horizontally.
- Added a narrow-screen toaster bottom-offset token and kept desktop/tablet toast positioning unchanged. At <=640px the toast stack now reserves 5.75rem plus any bottom safe-area inset so feedback stays above the persistent Article tools.
- Source Chromium after the fix measured zero overlap with about 16.8px clearance at 390×844 and 17.2px at 568×320; 820px retains the original 16px toaster offset. Added a permanent bookmark→toast geometry contract for both narrow viewports.
- Final fresh-mirror release gate PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; 32 Vitest files / 124 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge verification; production build/smoke with a 311,479-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 41/41; visual/structural Chromium 102/102. No screenshot baseline refresh was required.
- Follow-up scope check: the first implementation raised every narrow-screen toast, including Home where no fixed Article tools exist. The offset is now conditional on the stable `data-mobile-article-tools` marker via `body:has(...)`: Home remains at the normal 16px bottom offset while Article keeps the 92px clearance. Source Chromium confirms both states.
- Modal-layer follow-up found another real collision at short height: a settled Home bookmark toast overlapped the 568×320 Command Palette by about 9,396px² and overlaid the mobile drawer by about 12,096px² because react-hot-toast sits at z-index 9999. Global transient toasts now yield visually while any real `[role="dialog"]` is mounted, then return after the modal closes; screen-reader status DOM is preserved.
- Source Chromium verifies toaster opacity returns from 0 to 1 after both Command Palette and drawer dismissal. Targeted official Playwright contracts pass 2/2 for Article-toolbar clearance plus modal-layer yielding.

## 2026-08-30 — Async Home anchor and browser-history scroll stability
- Hosted production smoke for `09c080d` exposed a production-only Command Palette failure that local fallback-only gates could not reproduce: while the reader was at `scrollY=700`, fallback content upgraded to the live Supabase catalogue behind the open palette and `#knowledge-feed` moved exactly 73.125px in the viewport.
- Live 100ms Chromium sampling isolated the geometry change. The fallback notice contributed 102.594px and disappeared while the live featured hero grew by about 29.469px, producing the net -73.125px feed shift. The previous Home compensation stored only the first fallback anchor, so font/layout settling could make that reference stale before live data arrived.
- Added `useScrollAnchorTransition`: while the fallback state is active it refreshes the feed absolute-top anchor every animation frame; when live data replaces fallback, the last pre-transition anchor is used for a pre-paint scroll compensation. A deterministic delayed mock-Supabase reproduction forced fallback→live while Command Palette was open 10/10 times; viewport drift stayed at 0.344px instead of ~73px.
- Preserved and verified the concurrent browser-history scroll work already present in the worktree: POP navigation restores saved per-history-entry scroll positions, Home filtered deep links do not fight history restoration, and Command Palette dismissal no longer blindly rewrites `scrollY` after dynamic layout changes. Targeted source Chromium passes 2/2 for filtered back-navigation and palette anchor locking.
- Fresh-mirror release gates PASS: npm audit 0 vulnerabilities; deterministic knowledge/security verification; 33 Vitest files / 126 tests; lint; production build/smoke with a 313,435-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 43/43; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 102/102. Existing screenshot baselines remained unchanged.

## 2026-08-31 — Auth/profile resilience and route-state correctness
- Continued the post-visual closeout through loading, failure and feedback states. ProtectedRoute previously converted a still-unresolved 3-second auth check into an automatic login redirect. Slow auth now stays neutral: the initial SystemStatus is `aria-busy`, and after the threshold the page explains that session checking is slow and offers an explicit login link without deciding the session is invalid.
- Fixed auth/profile hydration at the source. A valid Supabase auth user is now stored before the optional profile query; if profile enrichment is unavailable, the session remains authenticated with `profile: null`. Email/password login follows the same rule and no longer reports “Login failed” after authentication already succeeded merely because profile enrichment failed.
- Removed ProfilePage's redundant 2-second spinner/login timer because `/profile` is already gated by ProtectedRoute. The improbable valid-session/no-user state now uses a retryable SystemStatus instead of self-redirecting. Knowledge Health loading was moved from a raw 55vh text block to the same busy status system.
- Audited user-visible mutation failure fallbacks. Post creation had fallen back to registration copy, while update/delete could fall back to success messages. Create/update/delete now use dedicated TR/EN error copy; missing auth logout/profile-update fallback keys were also added.
- Added a source-wide static i18n contract. Its first run exposed two existing Turkish gaps (`validation.passwordMismatch`, `validation.usernameFormat`); both are now translated, and a 390px Chromium registration contract confirms the Turkish validation copy renders without raw translation keys or horizontal overflow.
- Removed the unreachable Home loading skeleton/wake-up timer and its CSS/i18n copy. React Query always seeds the public catalogue from fallback data, so the real startup path is fallback-first plus live refresh. Existing Home light/dark desktop/mobile baselines passed compare-only 4/4 after removal.
- Corrected Article route semantics. Known fallback stories remain readable when Supabase is unavailable; live-only stories now propagate backend failure instead of being misreported as missing. Article loading uses a shared busy status, service failure is retryable, and a resolved null story receives a separate not-found recovery link to Explore.
- Targeted regressions cover slow ProtectedRoute auth, auth/profile enrichment failure, login with profile failure, post mutation feedback, static TR/EN translation coverage, Profile recovery, Knowledge loading, Article fallback/error/not-found states and Turkish browser validation. All targeted runs are green before the full fresh release gate.
- Fresh release gate for this closeout tranche: 39 Vitest files / 144 tests PASS, functional Chromium 44/44 PASS, visual/structural Chromium 102/102 PASS, npm audit 0 vulnerabilities, lint/knowledge/build/smoke PASS. Existing visual baselines remained unchanged. Production entry is 314,503 bytes and remains below the 320 KB release budget.

### Inline evidence feedback UI closeout
- Replaced native `window.prompt()` evidence capture with an inline, locale-aware form inside the article evidence section.
- Added explicit pressed/expanded semantics for evidence and shelf controls, status-vs-alert messaging, and 44px tablet touch targets.
- Verified in real Chromium at 390px and 820px in light/dark: zero native dialogs, zero horizontal overflow, 44px minimum controls, saved environment feedback rendered inline.
- Added deterministic unit coverage and a Chromium product contract for the full inline save flow.
- Fresh release gate: 40 files / 146 unit tests, 45/45 functional Chromium, 102/102 visual/structural, lint/security/build/smoke PASS; main entry 314,503 B under the 320 KB budget.

- UI closeout — in-product confirmation surfaces: replaced the remaining Admin delete and Editor unsaved-leave / Markdown-replace native browser confirmations with a shared Postify `ConfirmDialog`. The dialog uses product theme tokens, 46px action targets (so the opening scale animation never dips below 44px), mobile/short-height containment, reduced-motion support, explicit cancel-first autofocus, and deterministic focus restoration. Admin deletion now moves focus to the Content tab after the deleted row disappears instead of dropping focus to `body`. Targeted Chromium coverage passes 3/3, including real delete/import actions and a new mobile pixel baseline.
- ConfirmDialog final fresh release gate PASS on current `71a2553` base: 40 Vitest files / 146 unit tests, 45/45 functional Chromium, 105/105 visual/structural Chromium, release security/knowledge/lint/build/smoke all PASS, 0 audit vulnerabilities, and 314,626-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-08-31 — Tablet auxiliary touch-target closeout
- Production Chromium measurements at 600/820/960px found several controls still using phone-only hit-area breakpoints: drawer LanguageSwitcher was 40px at 820/960, article code Copy and Copy-link actions were 40px at 820/960, Verification Runbook Reset was 38px throughout the tablet range, Hero Browse/Contribute links were 38px at 820/960, and the evidence-source link was only 16px high at 820/960.
- Aligned only interaction hit areas (not layout/reflow) to the Header touch-mode breakpoint: LanguageSwitcher, Hero actions, CopyableCodeBlock, CopyLinkButton, VerificationRunbook actions, and evidence links are now at least 44px through 960px.
- Extended the existing deterministic tablet touch contract to 600/820/960 and pre-seeded runbook progress so the Reset action is measured without asynchronous fallback/query state affecting the test.
- Targeted Playwright visual/structural contract: 1/1 PASS.

- Article context-return audit: production 04e2cc8 confirmed the old Article Back control always reset to `/` and lost filtered Home URL/scroll context. The pending history-aware Back control now returns through in-app history when available and falls back safely to Home for direct deep links; functional release coverage passed 46/46 before the visual selector contract was updated from link to button semantics.
- Fresh Article context-return release gate PASS: 40 Vitest files / 146 tests, 46/46 functional Chromium, 105/105 visual/structural, lint/build/smoke/security all green; main entry 314,626 B remains under the 320 KB budget.

- Command Palette short-viewport keyboard audit: production 3d2c7ca let ArrowDown move the active descendant to an off-screen result at 568×320 (`scrollTop=0` while the active option was ~200px below the result viewport). The active option now scrolls into the result rail with `block: nearest`; targeted Chromium confirms the sixth result stays visible and Enter opens it.

- Crash-recovery keyboard audit: deterministic ErrorBoundary render left focus on `BODY` at both 390px and 1304px. The recovery fallback now moves focus to the Retry action without scrolling, and the action is explicitly non-submit (`type=button`).
- ErrorBoundary focus final fresh release gate PASS after removing the stale Postify-only slow-mock listener that occupied port 4500: 40 Vitest files / 146 tests, functional Chromium 47/47, visual/structural Chromium 106/106, npm audit 0 vulnerabilities, lint/knowledge/build/smoke PASS, and a 314,722-byte main entry under the 320 KB budget. The only intended pixel change is the mobile recovery Retry focus ring.

### 2026-08-31 — Discovery filter hierarchy and microtype readability
- Re-audited the live Home surface at the user's desktop scale instead of relying only on existing screenshots. At 1304px the flat discovery toolbar wrapped accidentally as 9 controls on one row plus 3 orphaned controls on the next; multiple meaningful Home labels also rendered at roughly 9.2–10.7px.
- Rebuilt the desktop discovery controls as two explicit `Format / Biçim` and `Refine / Daralt` groups with compact raised selected states and no divider-grid noise. At <=960px the same controls flatten back into one 44px horizontal touch rail, so tablet/mobile density is preserved instead of growing into multi-row filter blocks.
- Raised critical Home/Topic/KnowledgeCard microcopy to roughly an 11px floor while preserving the high-density card rhythm. After tuning, 390px Home measured about 3719px of main-content height, slightly below the previous 3759px baseline despite the readability gain; document horizontal overflow remains zero.
- Targeted Chromium contracts PASS for desktop format navigation, mobile overflow/touch behavior, single-row discovery scrolling, and tablet 44px targets. Only the expected Home/Author light/dark desktop/mobile baselines changed; the refreshed 8-snapshot set passes compare-only 8/8.

### 2026-09-01 — Discovery toolbar and progressive filter disclosure
- Replaced the dense Home discovery filter stack with a quieter hierarchy: Topics remain a lightweight text rail, content format is a single segmented control, and evidence/order/reading refinements move behind one explicit `Filters / Filtreler` trigger.
- Added a dedicated lazy-loaded `DiscoveryFilterPopover`. Desktop/tablet placement adapts above or below its trigger to stay inside the viewport; <=560px uses a contained bottom-sheet treatment. Opening the panel does not increase discovery layout height, Escape restores focus to the trigger, outside pointer dismissal is supported, and active refinements remain visible as removable summary chips after the panel closes.
- Kept filter semantics grounded in existing data only: current evidence, author-tested, community-confirmed, Postify-verified, evidence/latest ordering, and <=5-minute reading. No new evidence claims or fabricated counts were introduced.
- Browser stress covers 320px/390px mobile, 820px tablet, 1304px/1440px desktop, 568x320/667x375/844x390 short landscape, light/dark visual baselines, history-position restoration, 44px touch targets and 200% text scaling without horizontal escape.
- The first implementation pushed the main entry to 321,020 bytes, above the 320 KB release budget. The advanced panel was split behind a lazy boundary instead of raising the budget; the final main entry is 316,878 bytes and the popover ships as a separate ~4.23 KB minified chunk.
- Final pre-merge gate on the exact UI tree PASS: release security with 0 npm vulnerabilities; 40 Vitest files / 146 tests; lint; deterministic knowledge/runtime verification; production build/smoke; functional Chromium 50/50; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 108/108. Intentional Home light/dark desktop/mobile baselines and new desktop/mobile popover baselines were refreshed and then passed compare-only.

### 2026-09-01 — Article reading hierarchy and semantic outline polish
- Audited the live Article surface with production Chromium instead of changing typography by inspection. On the verified Node.js story, the old Quick Brief consumed ~126px desktop / ~165px mobile while repeating content type, reading time and date already available elsewhere; the mobile inline outline consumed ~291px before body content.
- Simplified Quick Brief to the single reader-value promise ("what will you get from this?") and moved reading time out of the duplicate Quick Brief/desktop rail presentation and into the compact header metadata row. The brief now measures ~78px desktop / ~97px mobile on the same story, and mobile cover/content starts ~69–85px earlier.
- Replaced the always-open <=780px article outline with a native `details` disclosure. Closed height is ~48px at 390px; opening preserves all headings, >=44px link hit areas, keyboard focus behavior and zero horizontal overflow at 320px with 200% text scaling. Desktop keeps the immediately visible outline.
- The visual audit exposed a deeper parser bug: when a Markdown heading and its following paragraph shared one blank-line block, both `getArticleOutline()` and `PlainArticleBody` treated the paragraph as part of the heading. Added `splitArticleBlocks()` so heading lines and following body copy are normalized separately. Outline labels are now exactly `Problem / Code / Verification`; desktop outline height on the audited story dropped from ~201px to ~98px, and body headings render as real headings rather than oversized heading+paragraph blocks.
- Refreshed only the four intended Article light/dark desktop/mobile baselines. Home screenshot stability was challenged after a one-off 2px full-suite jitter; 10 repeated desktop + 10 repeated mobile Home baselines passed 20/20 on a fresh server, then the full visual suite passed cleanly.
- Final exact-source gate: release security PASS with 0 npm vulnerabilities and digest-pinned CI/Docker images; deterministic knowledge/runtime verification PASS; 40 Vitest files / 147 tests PASS; lint PASS; production build/smoke PASS with 316,878-byte main entry below the 320 KB budget; functional Chromium 50/50 PASS; deterministic visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS.

### 2026-09-01 — Article evidence density and progressive verification details
- Re-audited the verified Article lower-reading flow after the heading/parser and mobile-outline cleanup. The always-expanded evidence block still dominated the post-reading surface: about 759px on desktop and 956px on 390px mobile for the deterministic Node example.
- Kept the actual trust verdict visible at all times (`Postify verified` / runtime freshness), but moved the execution contract, author test date, environment, prerequisites, verification steps, caveats and evidence sources behind one native `Verification details / Doğrulama ayrıntıları` disclosure.
- Closed evidence height dropped to about 238px desktop and 275px mobile while preserving all technical proof on demand. On mobile, the disclosure summary remains >=44px; source/artifact links remain >=44px when expanded; 320px at 200% text scaling has zero horizontal overflow.
- Updated Verified Knowledge E2E contracts so historical execution proof and current verification state remain independently asserted even though technical details are progressively disclosed. Tablet touch coverage now opens the evidence disclosure before measuring source links.
- Hardened visual-test settling for Home by requiring several consecutive stable geometry samples before screenshot capture; this addresses the recurring 2887/2889px two-pixel async settling flake without changing product UI or snapshot tolerances.
- Final local gate on the exact tree: release security PASS with 0 npm vulnerabilities; 40 Vitest files / 147 tests PASS; functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS; lint/knowledge/runtime/build/smoke PASS; main entry 316,878 bytes under the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Semantic discovery history restoration
- Production Chromium smoke on `edc1f5415b94ebc0bed74225283f78c55f993a27` exposed a real dynamic-feed return bug: after opening an article from filtered discovery and using Back, raw `scrollY` restoration could land roughly 148px away once fallback/live feed content re-rendered; the test could also bind to a card node that was replaced during the same transition.
- Discovery cards now expose a stable semantic scroll-anchor key derived from their article href. App history state stores the topmost visible card key plus its viewport offset alongside raw scroll coordinates.
- On POP restoration, Postify preferentially re-resolves that semantic card and compensates its viewport delta while async feed content settles; raw pixel restoration remains the fallback when the card is not present yet. Restoration stops immediately on real user interaction so it cannot fight manual scrolling.
- History E2E now measures visual feed/card position rather than raw scroll pixels and resolves links after feed stabilization. The production-discovered scenario passed 10/10 local repetitions after the fix.
- Final exact-source gate: semantic-anchor unit coverage 2/2 plus existing transition tests 2/2; full Vitest 41 files / 149 tests PASS; functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS; release security/knowledge/lint/build/smoke PASS; main entry 317,879 bytes under the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Editorial discovery feed polish and deterministic return context
- Reworked the visible Home/Author knowledge-card system after the filter toolbar modernization so the feed reads as an editorial index rather than a dashboard: circular ordinal badges were removed, trust facts became one quiet evidence rail instead of boxed cells, featured/standard typography gained stronger hierarchy, and hover/shadow decoration was reduced.
- The result count was demoted from a pill to quiet mono metadata. At 1440px the featured title now renders at ~56.8px / weight 520; at 390px it renders at ~37.4px. Horizontal overflow remains zero at 1440/820/390/320.
- Narrow-mobile density was tuned separately: at 320px standard cards expose the two highest-value trust facts in one two-column rail, reducing each audited standard card from ~319px to ~290px and the page by ~87px without removing the full evidence available in the article.
- Production stress on the preceding semantic-history release exposed two mobile-only causes of residual jumps: Chromium native scroll anchoring could double-compensate the fallback→live transition (~73.75px), and generic viewport-anchor capture could remember the card crossing the viewport top rather than the card the reader actually opened.
- Home now owns scroll anchoring explicitly while mounted, and article navigation captures the exact clicked card key + viewport offset before route transition. The current source passed the discovery/article/Back scenario 20/20 repeatedly, plus 51/51 functional Chromium and 108/108 visual/structural Chromium.
- Final release gate on the exact source: 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; release security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry 318,560 bytes below the existing 320 KB budget. Only the intended Home and public Author light/dark desktop/mobile baselines changed (8 snapshots).

### 2026-09-01 — Article reading surface editorial polish
- Rebalanced the Article reading surface so the post feels like a premium editorial knowledge page rather than a utility report: the display title is larger but lighter, the cover now sits in a restrained framed surface, and the reading column moved to a narrower ~64ch measure with more deliberate paragraph/heading rhythm.
- Desktop `On this page` now reads as a horizontal editorial index with top/bottom rules instead of a left-accent utility block. Mobile keeps the existing native disclosure and touch-safe links rather than inheriting the desktop layout.
- External references received a source-section hierarchy ready for body URLs, while the active discussion heading and previous/next navigation now use the display type system. Previous/next became a larger two-column editorial close on desktop and a compact stacked close on mobile.
- Real Chromium geometry remained contained at 1440/390/320 with zero horizontal overflow. Audited title size is ~74.9px desktop and ~44.9px at 390; the article body reads at ~623px on desktop and full available width on mobile.
- Exact-source gate: targeted Article E2E 7/7 PASS; full functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS after refreshing only the four intended Article light/dark desktop/mobile baselines; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; release security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry remains 318,560 bytes under the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Publishing workspace visual redesign
- Reworked Create/Edit knowledge from a long utility form into a clearer publishing workspace without changing the publish/evidence behavior: format selection now reads as an editorial numbered chooser, the writing side is one restrained document canvas, and publication/evidence readiness is visually separated as a compact inspector.
- RichTextEditor gained a contained writing surface with a quiet toolbar band, more deliberate prose rhythm and clearer focus treatment. The title field and evidence heading now use the same lighter display hierarchy as the public reading surface.
- Publish is now the single primary accent CTA; cancel remains secondary. Mobile actions split into a stable two-column action row, while the editor toolbar remains horizontally touch-safe.
- Real Chromium geometry at 1440/390/320: document/form horizontal overflow remains 0; desktop workspace resolves to ~780px writing canvas + 300px inspector; mobile stacks both at full available width. Existing touch, focus, Markdown import/export, validation, canonical-source and 200% text-scaling contracts remain intact.
- Exact-source gate: functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS after refreshing only six intended Create/Edit/Editor light/dark desktop/mobile baselines; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; release security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry remains 318,560 bytes below the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Home masthead and cover-story redesign
- Rebalanced the Home first screen so the product opens like an editorial knowledge publication rather than a collection of product cards: the display title is larger/lighter, the search field is now the dominant 64px discovery control on desktop, and the Browse CTA uses the primary accent.
- Reworked the featured story from a rounded elevated card into a rule-based cover-story composition with a framed image, stronger display headline and calmer metadata. The change removes another layer of dashboard/card chrome while keeping the same content and navigation semantics.
- Utility/promise treatment was quieted and the main hero spacing widened so title, discovery action and cover story read as one composition. Mobile keeps the same hierarchy with a 56px search control and a stacked rule-based cover story.
- Real Chromium geometry remained contained at 1440/820/390/320 with horizontal overflow 0. Audited search height is 64px desktop/tablet and 56px mobile; the mobile cover story remains fully contained at 358px available width.
- Exact-source gate: targeted Home interaction 6/6 PASS; full functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS after refreshing only the four intended Home light/dark desktop/mobile baselines; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; release security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry remains 318,560 bytes below the 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Global navigation shell polish
- Reworked the shared Header so the brand/navigation/actions read as one editorial system instead of equally weighted utility controls. Desktop format navigation now carries quiet numbered indices, active state is a restrained underline, and search/language/theme/account controls recede behind the primary write/login action.
- Mobile navigation is now a full editorial index: stronger Postify masthead, dedicated search surface, numbered navigation rows, clearer current-route treatment, and a separated utility/footer area. The 390/320 layouts stay horizontally contained; the 320×700 drawer scrolls internally rather than escaping the viewport.
- Preserved the existing global shell heights (64px desktop/tablet, 58px narrow mobile) so the redesign does not introduce page-layout churn. At 961px desktop navigation remains contained; at 960px the drawer breakpoint takes over cleanly.
- Exact-source verification: Header unit 3/3 PASS; targeted navigation/accessibility Chromium 7/7 PASS; full functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS after refreshing the 22 intentional snapshots that actually include the global shell; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry 319,043 bytes under the existing 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Editorial footer close and trust rail polish
- Reworked the shared Footer so public pages close like a knowledge publication rather than a dense sitemap: the closing statement is larger/lighter, Explore is the single accent CTA, the secondary writing action is quieter, and format/product links now read as indexed navigation instead of equal-weight utility rows.
- Expanded the desktop trust rail from three labels into short Evidence / Freshness / Reproducibility explanations while keeping the mobile rail compact. Brand/GitHub/navigation hierarchy remains semantic and all existing routes/actions are unchanged.
- Mobile density stayed effectively flat despite the stronger visual hierarchy: audited footer height moved from ~971px to ~979px at 390 and ~945px to ~959px at 320, with horizontal overflow 0. At 200% text scaling the footer stays horizontally contained and all interactive controls remain >=44px.
- The 200% scaling gate exposed a real CSS Grid min-content escape in the closing CTA column. The action track is now `minmax(0, 1fr)` with a zero min-width, so 320px/200% links resolve to the exact 272px available container instead of expanding to ~301px.
- Exact-source gate: functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS after refreshing only the 12 intentional baselines that actually include the footer; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; release security/knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; 0 npm vulnerabilities; main entry 319,496 bytes under the existing 320 KB budget.

### 2026-09-01 — Auth entry surfaces editorial redesign
- Production browser comparison across Login, Register, Password Recovery, About, Contact and Not Found showed the remaining visual outlier: the auth forms still sat inside a 10px rounded, shadowed SaaS-style card while the public editorial pages had already moved to rule-based hierarchy.
- Reworked Login, Register, Forgot Password and Reset Password as open editorial form rails without changing authentication or validation behavior. The rounded/elevated card shell is gone; desktop uses one structural vertical rule between the account context and the form, while narrow mobile flips that separation to a top rule.
- Login/Register benefit copy now reads as a quiet numbered index, primary submit actions use the existing Postify accent, and OAuth choices are a flat two-column ruled rail instead of two mini-cards. Titles use the lighter display hierarchy established by Home/Article/Editor.
- Kept the tranche CSS-only to protect the 320 KB eager-entry budget. No new JavaScript, package, route, auth state or persistence behavior was added.
- Source Chromium functional contracts for login operability, validation/focus/touch recovery and 320px at 200% text scaling pass 3/3. Targeted light/dark auth visual coverage intentionally refreshed only the 8 desktop Login/Register/Forgot/Reset baselines; the immediate compare-only rerun passes 16/16, including all existing mobile geometry contracts.
- Fresh-mirror exact-source release gate completed after the redesign: clean npm install/audit 0 vulnerabilities; release security PASS; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; deterministic knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS; full functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; full visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS. The main eager entry remains exactly 319,496 bytes, so the auth redesign adds no eager JavaScript weight.

### 2026-09-01 — Profile dashboard editorial redesign
- Auth production closeout completed first: PR #68 merged at main SHA `7318a37b2e09843009a60a4e4888aa8e427aedea`; main-push CI/CD, deploy and Production Chromium & Release Smoke all passed; production `release.json` matched the exact SHA. Independent production Chromium also passed Login/Register/Recovery at 1440/390/320, dark mode and 320px/200% text scaling with zero horizontal overflow, >=44px mobile actions and no rounded/shadow auth shell.
- Audited the remaining authenticated surfaces after the auth release. Bookmarks and Knowledge Health already use rule-based editorial index/queue layouts; Profile remained the largest visual outlier with 14px rounded identity/action/dashboard cards, nested stat/metric cards and hover-lift quick actions.
- Reworked Profile as a CSS-only editorial account workspace: identity is now an open masthead, account stats share one ruled strip, account actions are flat rows, profile editing is a ruled inline workspace, and the four summary areas plus quick access share border-based grids instead of independent cards.
- No profile/auth/persistence behavior changed and no JavaScript was added. Isolated Chromium geometry passes at 390px, 320px dark and 320px at 200% text scaling with zero horizontal overflow, no escaped controls, >=44px measured touch targets and zero article radius/shadow. Only the six intended Profile dashboard/editor light/dark desktop/mobile baselines were refreshed; immediate compare-only rerun passes 6/6.
- Fresh-mirror exact-source release gate completed: npm audit 0; release security PASS; 41 Vitest files / 150 tests PASS; full functional Chromium 51/51 PASS; full visual/structural Chromium 108/108 PASS; knowledge/runtime/lint/build/smoke PASS. The eager main entry remains exactly 319,496 bytes, so this Profile redesign also adds zero eager JavaScript weight.

### 2026-09-01 — Admin operator ledger polish
- Reworked the Admin overview from a boxed five-cell dashboard into a ruled operator metric rail with quieter icons, larger editorial numbers and no outer left/bottom cell boxing.
- Simplified management surfaces into a calmer ledger: table headers no longer use filled dashboard bands, role/status badges are flat semantic labels, role selectors use a ruled control treatment, and row actions are borderless utilities rather than mini-cards.
- Narrow mobile keeps the five metrics visible in a compact 2+2+1 rail instead of a five-row stack; audited Admin dashboard height at 390 dropped from ~1568px to ~1379px.
- 320px at 200% text scaling exposed a real tab-rail escape. At <=390px the three Admin sections now use equal wrap-safe columns, eliminating horizontal control escape while retaining the existing roving keyboard tab model.
- Targeted Admin Chromium: 12/12 PASS after refreshing only the ten intentional Admin baselines affected by the operator-ledger and narrow-tab changes. Dedicated 390/320/dark/200% geometry QA: 3/3 PASS with horizontal overflow 0 and interactive targets >=44px.

### 2026-09-01 — Command search editorial index polish
- Closed the preceding Admin release first: main SHA `80cfdc8d07f51c4119fdfbcd9f633733eead0b60` completed the main-push CI/CD pipeline, including Chromium Product E2E, GitHub Pages deploy and Production Chromium & Release Smoke; production `release.json` matches that exact SHA.
- Reworked the lazy Command Palette as a flat editorial search index rather than a rounded elevated modal card: structural top/bottom rules replace the rounded shell, search becomes an underline rail, result rows use separators and display typography, and selected results use a quiet directional wash instead of boxed hover cards.
- Kept the tranche CSS-only, preserving all existing focus trap, keyboard selection, lazy loading, background scroll lock and navigation behavior. Dedicated command interaction coverage passes 5/5; visual/containment coverage passes 3/3; 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling geometry passes 3/3 with no horizontally escaped controls and >=44px close action.
- Exact source security/unit/lint/knowledge/runtime/build/smoke gate passes with 41 Vitest files / 150 tests and 0 npm vulnerabilities; eager main entry remains exactly 319,496 bytes. Full functional Chromium passes 51/51. Full visual suite reached the pre-existing Home dark desktop screenshot settling flake (2968/2969px alternating height) after the Command Palette tests had already passed; no unrelated Home baseline was refreshed.

### 2026-09-02 — Public author folio editorial polish
- After exact production closeout at `de0c6ef2b5f11f51631fe7d0c6221ab9a972dcc3`, selected the public author portfolio as the next visible consistency gap; Bookmarks and Knowledge Health are already using the current rule-based editorial system.
- Reworked only `UserPage.module.css`: the social-profile-like circular monogram became a compact folio marker with a typographic top rule, and the icon-led three-stat strip became a quieter metadata ledger. Public author data, evidence counts, bookmark behavior and the shared EditorialFeed remain unchanged.
- Graphify impact query/update completed. Targeted visual baselines show the intended change on desktop/mobile; compare-only rerun passes 2/2. Dedicated 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling QA passes 3/3 with no horizontal overflow or escaped controls and >=44px bookmark touch targets.

### 2026-09-02 — Unified editorial system states
- Replaced the PersistGate bootstrap spinner with the existing shared `SystemStatus` loading surface, so first hydration, lazy route loading and recovery states now speak one visual language instead of switching to a generic circular app spinner.
- Tightened the shared recovery treatment with a stronger editorial top rule, flat underlined recovery actions and a ruled debug-details panel; focus, retry/home behavior and reduced-motion progress semantics remain unchanged.
- Dedicated bootstrap-equivalent Chromium geometry passes at 1440, 390, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling (4/4); recovery focus/visual targeted coverage passes 5/5. The simplification reduces the eager entry from 319,496 B to 319,234 B.

### 2026-09-02 — Discovery refinement sheet editorial polish
- Flattened the advanced Discovery Filters surface from a rounded SaaS popover / nested option-card treatment into a ruled editorial refinement sheet: strong top rule, separated option rows, square state markers and display typography for the refinement heading.
- Preserved the existing progressive-disclosure behavior, URL/shareable filter state, lazy loading and mobile bottom-sheet interaction; this tranche is CSS-only and adds no eager JavaScript.
- Raised close/reset controls to a 44px minimum target on all viewports and kept the mobile option list single-column for 320/390 and 200% text scaling containment.

### 2026-09-02 — Editorial confirmation decision panel
- Reframed the shared destructive/default confirmation dialog from a rounded shadow-heavy app modal into a flat editorial decision panel with a strong top rule, restrained lower rule and quieter overlay.
- Kept the cancel action visually secondary as an underlined text action while preserving one strong confirm/destructive action; Radix focus restoration, Escape/outside-click handling, busy-state blocking and reduced-motion behavior remain unchanged.
- This shared surface affects Admin content deletion and Create/Edit confirmation flows without adding JavaScript behavior or a new visual primitive.

### 2026-09-02 — Manuscript canvas + margin inspector polish
- Removed the remaining large rounded-panel chrome from the Create/Edit writing canvas so the title, body editor and evidence fields read as one continuous manuscript beneath a strong editorial rule rather than as a form card.
- Flattened the readiness inspector into a ruled margin column and converted readiness state pills into quiet monospace status underlines. The publish/readiness logic, evidence fields, editor behavior and primary action semantics are unchanged.
- Mobile/tablet collapse removes the inspector side rule and manuscript side padding instead of reintroducing rounded cards; targeted 320/390/200% text scaling and full Chromium gates are required before release.

### 2026-09-02 — Home hero search/action rail polish
- Removed the remaining rounded/shadow application-card treatment from the Home masthead search control and converted it into a rule-based editorial search rail while preserving the same search state and Command Search hint.
- Flattened the masthead's primary/secondary actions into publication-style ruled actions rather than rounded app buttons, and squared the cover-story image frame so the public entry surface remains visually coherent with the editorial knowledge index.
- Kept the tranche CSS-only; no eager JavaScript or search behavior changed. Graphify impact/update, desktop/mobile Chromium screenshots, dark/200% text geometry, functional search state and exact release gates remain required before release.

### 2026-09-02 — Mobile menu first-open latency fix
- Root cause was measured in production: the lazy `sheet-*.js` request did not start until the hamburger click, leaving the Suspense fallback empty while the first drawer chunk downloaded; observed click-to-visible latency was 883 ms in a cold production probe.
- The Sheet module remains code-split, but its single module promise now starts as soon as Header is evaluated. The three lazy Sheet exports reuse that promise, removing the cold first-click network wait without moving the Sheet implementation into the eager entry bundle.
- Added a browser regression contract requiring the mobile Sheet resource to be present before the first hamburger click and the resulting drawer link to become visible immediately after that click. Current-source production build measures 92 ms click-to-visible versus 883 ms before the fix (~9.6× faster). Full gates pass: security/audit 0, 150/150 unit, 52/52 functional Chromium, 108/108 visual/structural; eager entry is 319,108 B.

### 2026-09-02 — Mobile menu Suspense mount delay removed
- Follow-up production instrumentation after the first prewarm fix showed the Sheet request already finished before interaction, but `aria-expanded` changed in ~7 ms while the Radix drawer DOM still mounted ~650 ms later. The remaining delay was first-render `React.lazy`/Suspense scheduling, not the network.
- The Sheet chunk remains dynamically imported and prewarmed, but Header now stores the resolved module and renders its Sheet exports directly once ready. The hamburger path therefore bypasses first-render Suspense while retaining code splitting.
- Tightened the browser regression contract to measure the actual click event → visible drawer mount and require it below 250 ms in CI.
- Production-style local Chromium measurement after removing first-use Suspense: click → `aria-expanded`, dialog mount and close-button mount all converge at ~60.5 ms, down from the measured ~650 ms mount delay in the prewarm-only release. Full release gate passes 150/150 unit, 52/52 functional Chromium and 108/108 visual/structural with entry 319,057 B.

### 2026-09-02 — Mobile drawer editorial control polish
- Continued the mobile navigation cleanup after the first-open latency fix: the drawer search surface is now a ruled editorial search rail instead of a rounded elevated control, and the hamburger active/hover state uses a flat underline rather than a mini-card background.
- Flattened the drawer login/logout and utility actions into ruled actions and reduced the drawer shadow so the numbered navigation remains the dominant hierarchy instead of nested app controls.
- Dedicated 390 light, 320 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text-scaling QA found a real footer overflow in the first pass: Login extended about 9.6px beyond the 320px viewport. The mobile footer now wraps safely, and the rerun passes 4/4 with zero horizontal overflow, no escaped controls, >=44px controls, a 0px search/login radius and a 2px editorial search rule.

### 2026-09-02 — Mobile article reading action rail
- Reframed the mobile Article floating tools from a rounded, shadow-heavy application pill into a flat reading action rail with a strong top rule, restrained bottom rule and square 44px actions.
- Kept Back, Bookmark, Comments and Copy Link behavior unchanged, including footer auto-hide, keyboard-focus yielding and toast collision handling; this tranche is CSS-only and adds no eager JavaScript.
- Dedicated Chromium QA passes at 390 light, 320 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling with zero horizontal overflow, no escaped controls, radius 0, shadow none, 2px top rule and >=44px targets.

### 2026-09-02 — Editorial account index popover
- Reworked the authenticated desktop Header account menu from a rounded dropdown/card treatment into a flat editorial account index: square folio marker, underlined trigger, strong popover top rule and separated 44px navigation/logout rows.
- Preserved profile, Knowledge Health, identity, Escape/focus restoration and logout behavior; this tranche is CSS-only and adds no eager JavaScript.
- Targeted Chromium baseline compare passes 1/1; Header unit behavior passes 3/3; dedicated 1440 light, 1024 dark and 1024 at 200% text scaling containment passes 3/3 with radius 0, 2px top rule, >=44px rows and zero horizontal overflow.

### 2026-09-02 — Desktop article reading-tools rail polish
- Reworked the desktop PostDetail sticky tools rail from circular social-app controls into the same ruled editorial reading-tools language as the production mobile action rail.
- Back, bookmark and copy-link actions now sit in a 2px-top-rule / 1px-bottom-rule index with square 44px minimum interaction rows; Copy Link keeps its accessible name while its label is visually collapsed inside the narrow rail.
- Graphify impact query covered PostDetailPage, CopyLinkButton, bookmarks and visual-regression surfaces; code graph was updated after the CSS change.
- Targeted Article desktop light/dark snapshots pass compare-only 2/2. Dedicated rail geometry passes 1440 light, 1024 dark and 1024 at 200% text scaling 3/3 with radius 0, top rule 2px, no shadow, >=44px controls and horizontal overflow 0.

### 2026-09-02 — Desktop header utility rail polish
- Reworked the global desktop Header utility cluster so Search, language, theme and Saved controls read as flat underline actions rather than rounded hover cards; authenticated New Content and anonymous Login remain strong accent actions but use square editorial geometry.
- The bookmark count marker is now a square mono count tab instead of a pill. Mobile drawer-specific login/footer rules remain untouched; the existing mobile drawer screenshot did not drift.
- Graphify query covered Header, LanguageSwitcher, App, auth/bookmarks/theme hooks, Header unit coverage and authenticated visual fixtures; the source graph was updated after the CSS change.
- Targeted Header unit behavior passes 3/3; authenticated header + mobile drawer visual compare passes 2/2. Dedicated 1440 public, 1180 authenticated, 1024 dark authenticated and 1024 at 200% text scaling QA passes 4/4 with radius 0, >=42px desktop controls and zero horizontal overflow.


### 2026-09-02 — Editorial toast notices
- Flattened the global react-hot-toast shell from a rounded bordered mini-card into a quiet editorial notice rail with a 2px top rule, 1px bottom rule, square corners and no shadow; success/error icon semantics, duration, bottom-right placement and overlay suppression remain unchanged.
- Existing toast interaction contracts pass 2/2, including mobile article action-bar clearance and modal-overlay yielding. Dedicated 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling geometry/style QA passes 3/3 with zero horizontal overflow.
- The eager entry remains under budget at 319,349 B (still below the pre-system-state 319,496 B baseline).

### 2026-09-03 — Desktop header utility rail polish
- Reworked desktop Search, Language, Theme and Saved controls from rounded hover cards into flat underline utilities; New Content/Login remain primary actions but now use square editorial CTA geometry.
- Preserved mobile drawer styling and all Header auth/bookmark/theme/language behaviors; no eager JavaScript was added.
- Targeted Header behavior passes 3/3, authenticated header + mobile drawer visual compare passes 2/2, and 1440 public / 1180 auth / 1024 dark / 1024 at 200% text scaling geometry passes 4/4 with >=42px controls and zero horizontal overflow.
- The stateful tablet visual contract was isolated per viewport after reproducing a cross-viewport SPA-state race; the unchanged control checks pass three consecutive isolated runs and the complete visual/structural suite passes 108/108. Security/audit is 0, unit 150/150, functional Chromium 52/52, and the eager entry remains 319,057 bytes.

### 2026-09-03 — Home editorial feed index polish
- Reworked the Home discovery toolbar from a rounded segmented-control strip into a flat editorial format rail with underlined active state, square refinement count, ruled Filters action and square removable refinement tags.
- Reworked the feed hierarchy itself: the featured story is now a top-ruled lead story instead of a rounded card; standard/compact stories are flat ledger rows; card images and bookmark controls are square; load-more and error/retry actions now follow the same ruled/square interaction language.
- Preserved discovery/filter behavior, bookmark semantics, feed variants and mobile layouts. Targeted Home behavior passes 3/3; light/dark Home + Discovery visual compare passes 6/6 with only the four Home baselines intentionally changed.
- Dedicated 1440 light, 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling geometry passes 4/4: lead/filter/action/image radii 0, featured top rule 2px, mobile touch controls >=44px and horizontal overflow 0.

### 2026-09-03 — Home shell editorial polish
- Removed the remaining decorative radial/linear Hero glow treatment so the Home masthead is carried by typography and rules rather than ambient gradient chrome; search and hero actions keep their existing behavior with flat ruled feedback.
- Converted the Topics strip from rounded hover tabs into a square underline index rail, and converted the advanced Discovery surface from a blurred shadow popover into an opaque flat sheet. On mobile the filter sheet is edge-to-edge at the bottom with safe-area padding.
- Targeted Home/discovery behavior passes 4/4 and targeted light/dark visual compare passes 6/6 with only the Discovery desktop/mobile baselines intentionally changed. Dedicated 1440 light, 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling QA passes 4/4 with zero document overflow, >=44px mobile topic/filter targets, radius 0 and no popover shadow/backdrop blur.
- Full release gate passes: security/audit 0, unit 150/150, functional Chromium 52/52, visual/structural Chromium 108/108, eager entry 319,057 bytes.

### 2026-09-04 — Home first-screen density polish
- Reduced the Home masthead/lead-story vertical footprint without removing search, primary actions or the featured record. Desktop Hero height dropped from about 697px to 559px and the first feed card now begins around 888px instead of 1082px at 1440×900.
- Reworked the <=640px featured story into a compact horizontal lead record; at 390×844 the Hero dropped from about 1007px to 541px and the first feed card moved from about 1470px to 943px. At 320×700 the first feed card moved from about 1433px to 931px.
- Dedicated 1440 light, 390 light, 320 dark and 320 at 200% text scaling QA passes with zero horizontal overflow and >=44px primary actions. Targeted Home/discovery behavior passes 5/5 and visual compare passes 6/6.
- The visual harness also now clips the mobile command-palette baseline to the stable integer CSS-pixel dialog height. This removes a single fractional bottom-row dependency on the underlying Home scroll height while keeping the entire dialog content, focus and >=44px option checks intact; three isolated runs and the full visual suite pass deterministically.
- Release gate: security/audit 0, unit 150/150, functional Chromium 52/52, visual/structural Chromium 108/108, eager entry 319,057 bytes.
